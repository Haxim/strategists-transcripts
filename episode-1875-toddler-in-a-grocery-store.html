            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">upside carter gravitas yeah yeah like the fact that like drake and jagmeet singh know one another Now, there&#39;s actually quite interesting from a Canadian cultural perspective. I find that to be quite interesting. So what does someone like Jagmeet Singh have to do when he obviously is no longer a political face, but transitioned? I&#39;m almost asking you celebrity PR, Carter, but</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">okay. It hurts. But, you know, if Jagmeet Singh is going to have another little round of 15 Minutes of Fame, Then he should use it for fundraising purposes to clean up the debt that he left the party and the existential threat that he left to the federal NDP and the future of social democracy in this country. How about we take that seriously, not the Kendrick</span>

            <span class="text">Kendrick Drake feud? Like, come on down to earth, buddy. There&#39;s a big old debt there. Figure it out and set the party up for success, which is something you never did in the time that you were leader of it.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">lay our tentacles into Jagmeet Singh for a few minutes. But now I have a serious question for you. And it&#39;s back to you, Shannon. Does the former leader have a actual responsibility to clear this debt? Talk to me from like a party perspective, because many people do not know this, and you could probably explain it greater than I do, but I&#39;ll give you the simplified version. The NDP have a building that they borrow against to raise money.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And I think they&#39;re the only political party on the federal scene that does so and does that, the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">the boring of the money leverage against the building. So this</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">this is an interesting sort of situation where what happens when a leader leaves? What have you historically seen? What do you think both the actual and moral responsibility for someone like Jagmeet Singh is in that regard?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Well, the federal party has never been left in a state like this, not even when they lost party status in 1993 to my recollection of it, although I joined the party around 97. But I was on the federal council in the late 90s, early 2000s and, you know, in in the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">the days when we had like 20 seats. So I saw their finances at that time. And I was around as well for when the party bought or essentially</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">essentially Labour bought the building for the party before the new election finance rules came into place that that that Kretchen brought in right in 2003 before the 2004 election. So that was the genesis of that. Steele and others pooled some, because in the olden times, Labour used to guarantee that loan, right,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">right, in some way, shape or form, because they could. Oh,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">wasn&#39;t aware of that. Oh,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s interesting. Yeah. And so when the legislation took that out, then Labour, before the legislation came in, Labour bought the building. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">And then the party, and that was essentially what, there were a couple of different things that came out of that legislation that helped the party build in the latent years. Number one was it allowed individual riding associations to do their own receipting and their own fundraising. And so you didn&#39;t have to necessarily do a revenue share or anything. So you were just amassing money in individual riding. So a Nathan Cullen, a Jack Layton, an Olivia Chow, these kinds of seats, then, you know, Brian Massey grew up over time, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">right? Because they could establish their own fundraising base. So that was what that legislation did for the party. And the other thing it did was it allowed them to borrow. But to your question, what responsibility does Jagmeet Singh have? I&#39;m not really sure if I can sort of reach back to it like a history time on</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">on when a leader had that kind of responsibility, because no leader has left the party in this kind of dire straits ever. Never. And so if he has an ability to help them get out of it, he should try because he set a really bad precedent here. And he has authored a lot of it.</span>

            <span class="text">No, but as a political practitioner, Commissioner, what responsibility would you have tasked with your principal, Jagmeet Singh, to clear the party&#39;s debt? Or would you have said, do you do your nominal bit? Do you participate at all? This is behind you. How do you even think about these things? We often talk about leadership campaigns, which are, of course, associated with your name and you ran for leadership. And we talked about the toxicity of leadership debts. This is interesting because it&#39;s a party that no longer has official party status, that has this ability to borrow, that did do that borrowing. It&#39;s got a long history and tenure. It&#39;s a very interesting situation. What responsibility do you hold Jagmeet Singh to from a practical practitioner&#39;s perspective?</span>

He has a moral responsibility, but that moral responsibility does not carry the weight of law or any of the truth of the matter is the leader is not responsible for the actual actions of the party during the actual campaign. One could argue he may not even have known. Now, if he didn&#39;t know, then I think he&#39;d be delinquent in</span>

Let&#39;s be honest saying if he had any capacity to do the fundraising, he would have raised the funds. He doesn&#39;t have the ability to do the fundraising. So he leaves a giant hole all for whoever chooses or is chosen to lead that party. I&#39;m not sure you&#39;re going to see a huge lineup of people going, yeah, I really want this challenge.

And so he&#39;ll probably go off into the private sector or go and practice law or do something else. I think, you know, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s got a number of things that he can do. He is a talented guy in certain respects. He just wasn&#39;t particularly talented at leading the federal NDP and creating one party, in my view, for the country. So he&#39;ll do that.

And this is leaning into the provincial side a bit more, but do you feel like the current situation we have with separatism in Alberta, could that metastasize to an operation on the federal level in any meaningful way? We&#39;ve always talked about it metastasizing into a splinter of the right provincially, but I&#39;m curious what role and impact, especially now that we&#39;re tripling down in Alberta, right? Like Polly is running in an Alberta seat. This is going to be an Alberta convention in January. You&#39;re probably calling a lot of Alberta ridings.

While conceding he&#39;s a terrorist person who likes the relative simplicity of imposing broad-based tariffs on goods from other countries to raise revenue and try to bring back jobs to the U.S., Trump said Carney has come forward with a different concept, and it&#39;s one some people like, and we&#39;re going to see if we can get to the bottom of it today. Quote, I think Mark has a more complex idea, but it&#39;s still very good. Unquote, Trump said of some sort of trade pitch that Carney has made to the Americans, a proposal that is yet to be made public. I think we&#39;re going to accomplish a lot, quote unquote, from Trump at the end there.</span>

He&#39;s already done it with the UK, and he&#39;s trying to do it with the whole world and he essentially said this morning you know everyone has our deal right because we&#39;ll just write them a letter and tell them that that that here&#39;s your across the board tariff for the rest of time that&#39;s the trade deal if you don&#39;t make a deal with us right and so i we know that&#39;s the default and so what carney is doing is putting something in front of him that does not bake in and across the board or even auto or steel specific tariff for the rest of time in a way that really rewrites the terms of kuzma that is what he is i you know without having seen anything that&#39;s what he&#39;s trying to do uh and and i don&#39;t think they could get it over the line for the g7 because there was too much in there that that baked in a fundamental rewrite of access to markets for us and so now we&#39;re going to go into this place where he&#39;s just trying to leverage the defense stuff and some of the procurement maybe uh some of that against you know if we do this then you will not tariff us on that is is my hunch i that&#39;s that&#39;s what my gut is of where this is going um and he&#39;s he&#39;s playing it out beautifully so far and and i have read some reporting that you know they tried to structure it in a way that would make uh the toddler happy as well right so in in smaller chunks of time because he doesn&#39;t like the everyone going around the horn seven people he doesn&#39;t like having to sit through a</span>

            <span class="text">I think that&#39;s such an important point, both the geography, but I also love your point about actually hosting. Hosting is not just providing the space for facilitation. We&#39;ve seen any good house party, the host introduces people to one another, is the person who knows the guest list the best, is the person who can circulate, is the person that can make introductions. And I think to that point you just made, Carter, Carney seems to be doing quite well. Now, I might be overreaching, you and I might be overreaching, which is why we have Shannon. Shannon, advice you&#39;d be giving to Carney over the next 24, what would they be?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, I think they&#39;ve played this pretty beautifully. Like, I guess we&#39;re all Carney-pilled in some ways. But I&#39;m finding a hard way to find fault with this, right? I mean, we&#39;ll see what comes out of the communique and we&#39;ll see what happens in the next 24 hours on the Israel-Iran conflict, because it could just kind of sort of pull the whole thing off in a different direction and even cause conflict in the attendees. It could possibly. But what he&#39;s done is he&#39;s recreated essentially the big countries of the G20 at the G7. He&#39;s provided some of those opportunities for Canada to look like a leader on the world stage. And despite the fact that when Trudeau became prime minister in 15, the whole thing was Canada is back on the world stage. age, we</span>

            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">And so watching that happen, kind of going back to some of that, you know, So Pearson era kind of leadership is something that I think a lot of Canadians, particularly the Canadians that elected Mark Carney because they were, you know, old people, are really looking for. And he is giving them what they want there and what they voted for. So I don&#39;t think there necessarily needs to be a tariff deal as long as as Trump is like saying like sort of nice mumbles like he already did.</span>

            <span class="text">and some of the bilat stuff, you know, that can go out and become headlines in their own right that don&#39;t even maybe have to do with Canadians. If the Aussies conclude some sort of deal with somebody or, you know, Brazil does some trade stuff, it kind of places us within to take our rightful place, I think, and as more of a player than we have been historically. And that is only a good thing, I think, as we go into some more turbulent global times. Two</span>

            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Well, people don&#39;t really care. So, you know, the polling data, the reason why Canada has never done it is because the polling data puts that pretty low on the billion dollars.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, it&#39;s not just expensive. It will displace a lot of programs when Canadians go, oh, yes, we need to tighten our belts. We should displace programs. And then when it&#39;s the stuff that comes into their bank account, they get mad, right? Because I don&#39;t think people quite get the extent to which that child tax benefit is a massive amount of money every month. month. And, you know, the seniors benefits are quite generous in this country compared to many other countries, indexed to inflation, all the rest of it.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">You know, there&#39;s a bunch of different ways in which the government of Canada supports our daily lives. And then there&#39;s the health and social transfers on top of that that supports our provinces. So the fiscal situation becomes extremely tight for something that people only</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Right. So there are risks and downsides to doing this once you start cutting things like employment, social development, Canada programs, once you start cutting Indigenous services or, you know, seniors benefits of various kinds, workforce development, stuff of various kinds, even border or passport services or you name it, the kind of stuff, CRA that the government of Canada does. I still think there are risks in in doing it. He&#39;s made the commitments. I have no earthly idea how he&#39;s going to get $9 billion extra out the door this year.</span>

            <span class="text">I think that it&#39;s underrated for the relationship with Trump.
