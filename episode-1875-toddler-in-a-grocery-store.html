We often talk about leadership campaigns, which are, of course, associated with your name and you ran for leadership. And we talked about the toxicity of leadership debts.

And so he&#39;ll probably go off into the private sector or go and practice law or do something else. I think, you know, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s got a number of things that he can do.

Quote, I think Mark has a more complex idea, but it&#39;s still very good.
