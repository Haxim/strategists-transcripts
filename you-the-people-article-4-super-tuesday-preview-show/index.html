          <div class="said">it seemed like the court would just slap it down and say, no, of course, the president of the United States is subject to the law. And the very fact that this is being heard, it&#39;s not even just that this might result in them agreeing that presidents are kings and above the law and that the rule of law is subordinate to the whims of the person in the office, which in its own right is, I think, very strange. But it&#39;s that even by them discussing it, even by them hearing arguments, they&#39;re pushing off the D.C. trial. And so now there&#39;s like no chance that&#39;s going to be resolved before the election, pretty much. Is that the understanding? Well,</div>
