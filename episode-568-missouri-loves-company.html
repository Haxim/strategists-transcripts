            <span class="text">Carter, his messages seem to be dominating the Democratic nomination. But if you are standing there right now as Bernie Sanders, what do you do? Do you wait this out? Do you stick around? Do you concede this? Do you take this to the convention? What do you do?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, normally candidates stay in until they&#39;ve run out of resources, right? So the resources question for Bernie Sanders seems to be, he seems to be in the enviable position of being able to raise money every time he opens his mouth so he may as well stay in uh there&#39;s obviously an audience and uh a donor market for his particular uh brand of of uh socialist chaos cory</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">cory is it is it just about money i mean carter talks about resources but we&#39;ve seen hillary clinton for example wait out barack obama in 2008 for six eight weeks when he had it locked up what is bernie sanders waiting for if you&#39;re on the campaign right now and what what are you waiting for or what are you trying to do lots</span>

            <span class="text">democratic party and that&#39;s that they actually set their platform as well right so they&#39;ll vote on different things becoming policies and if 40 plus percent of those are sanders delegates you only have to peel off a a few Clinton supporters to get what will be a very left-wing platform. Now, I want to be clear, that doesn&#39;t mean the president or any member of Congress needs to run on said platform. It&#39;s a bit of a symbolic thing in many ways. But if I&#39;m Sanders, I&#39;m definitely going to stick around for that, especially at this point, because I can and because I&#39;m likely to have many delegates. But I&#39;ll</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;ll go back to what I said last time, which is as long as you&#39;re in the race, you have a chance to win the race. And Bernie Sanders has no good reason to drop out. He&#39;s got the money. He&#39;s got the supporters. You could even argue, and I&#39;d love to talk a bit more about this,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that he&#39;s got the momentum right now. Whether that momentum is enough to push past Clinton, highly dubious just because of where he&#39;s coming back from. We&#39;ll</span>

            <span class="text">We&#39;ll talk about momentum. Yeah, that&#39;s a great point. We&#39;ll talk about momentum in a second. Stephen Carter, I see you rolling your eyes as it relates to that. We&#39;ll talk about it in a second. I want to ask a Hillary question, though. If you are Hillary, is it in your best interest right now as the Hillary campaign to ignore Bernie Sanders and let him be in the race? Or do you actively try to ensure that he leaves this race before the convention?</span>

            <span class="text">start with an M. But this is where we are. This is where we are. Bernie Sanders has made note of himself as this campaign has gone forward. And he&#39;s made himself a player in the Democratic Party, I think, for years to come.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, so, Corey, this was going to be – Carter talks about the momentum of Sanders being a nuisance. We&#39;ve had these conversations offline. Does it matter when he&#39;s got the win behind his back when the only thing that really seems to be the metric now are the delegates? He wins Michigan on that same night. Hillary Clinton gets the most delegates. How do you marry the two at this point? Well,</span>

We need to keep the race focused on Trump because he&#39;s the most viable not-Trump candidate. But make no mistake, Ted Cruz is a loathsome human being. And if people start thinking about, oh, do I want Ted Cruz to be the nominee? nominee, he&#39;s going to start sliding back in the pack.

You see Ohio. The calculation was that you need 113% of all the remaining delegates, effectively impossible going forward. What do you do? What do you hold out for?

But because Paul Ryan, for example, was not on the ballot, you can always spin a hypothetical like, well, you know – If he had run. If he had been, he could have potentially done it, and maybe those delegates would have gone for him and all that. And I think it creates a different situation there. But Kasich is where Kasich is. His best bet is actually to take the opposite of what I&#39;ve just said and pretty much be at the convention. And if it&#39;s a total cluster, just say, look, I was the only guy on the ballot. You can&#39;t bring someone in at the last minute. That&#39;s patently unfair. It&#39;s undemocratic. If you want somebody to win, it has to be somebody who was out there.</span>

Mitt Romney&#39;s been thrown around. First of all, let&#39;s talk about the likelihood of that, and secondly, how are people or how are these prospective candidates preparing for that going forward?

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, you talk likelihood. you know there are a lot of places you can bet on outcomes and what you find is there are actually people who are not in the republican contest with better odds on these betting markets than people that are in the republican contest right</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so i would say the likelihood is a non-zero likelihood i actually put a fair bit of predictive power into these markets because if you actually put money behind it you&#39;re probably not just taking a flyer um i</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">would say the likelihood is still low let&#39;s not overstate it i mean as much as we&#39;ve just spent all this time talking about hypotheticals and what could happen in brokered conventions or some people prefer contested conventions whatever you want whatever um the reality is at the end of the day it is most likely going to be donald j trump or ted cruz of calgary our homeboy so i</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">i mean that is the that those are the two most likely outcomes and why that is the case is because they will both get there they will realize that if it goes absolutely to shit neither of them wins and probably the guy with the most will say hey guy with the second most want to be my vp because</span>

Of course, no one in America is talking about how he promised to let them in much sooner, right? I mean, it was really a showcase for being a progressive as much as it was being a Canadian prime minister. And that has risks. And I think that while it was all very positive, and I think that it&#39;s likely a Democrat will be the president after November, I would put that at a 60-40.

And the line of questioning, and I find it fascinating, so complete credit to them, was what does this mean if progressivism has this image, this image being Trudeau and Obama and this concoction of this virality and visual imaging that Carter talks about? What does this mean for progressivism and more specifically conservatism in Canada? Should they also be trying to, you know, the next conservative leader pushing the envelope for what it means on visuals, on youth, on vibrancy? What should they be doing? Yeah,</span>

            <span class="text">progressives have always had the youth, right? I mean, it&#39;s just not that cool to be a conservative. And when you&#39;re big or when you&#39;re young, you want to think big. You want to change the world. You want to be grand, right? You want to solve all of those problems. You tackle the apartheids of the world. You tackle social inequality, injustice, racism, all of that. As you get a little older, your universe shrinks a bit. You start thinking about the problems a little bit closer to home until ultimately you sort of hit the point where you&#39;re like, I just want my home rental to go okay, right? And that is where the conservatives&#39; bread and butter has been, right? Those pocketbook issues that like that practical, I just need X. And if I can get care of X, you know, that&#39;s great. You have those concerns and those problems and somebody should be fighting for them. But are those our priority right now? I think that&#39;s ultimately a bit of a depressing thing</span>

            <span class="text">the knock against progressives, as long as I can remember, you know, through the, you know, 70s, 80s and 90s, and some of it&#39;s not so much remembering as history, was that they&#39;re just, they&#39;re not serious. They&#39;re flaky. You know, they are thinking big when we&#39;ve got to be taking care of the small. And the conservatives were the sensible people. I remember hearing once in the 2000 election that George W. Bush was successful relative to Al Gore because Al Gore reminded you of your first husband and George W. Bush reminded you of your second husband, the one you married after the first husband couldn&#39;t get anything done. It was like a total flake. Right. Right.</span>

Like if it&#39;s 9.9 or less, huge win for the government. They&#39;ve got us all expecting a larger than $10 billion deficit. I don&#39;t know. If it turns out that it&#39;s 10.4 though, I will say this.
