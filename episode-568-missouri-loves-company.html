Stephen Carter, I see you rolling your eyes as it relates to that. We&#39;ll talk about it in a second. I want to ask a Hillary question, though. If you are Hillary, is it in your best interest right now as the Hillary campaign to ignore Bernie Sanders and let him be in the race? Or do you actively try to ensure that he leaves this race before the convention?</div>

His best bet is actually to take the opposite of what I&#39;ve just said and pretty much be at the convention. And if it&#39;s a total cluster, just say, look, I was the only guy on the ballot.

I was on a panel with a conservative the other day who said how good it was, which tells you you&#39;re in rare territory because there&#39;s not even something really to complain about.

Of course, no one in America is talking about how he promised to let them in much sooner, right? I mean, it was really a showcase for being a progressive as much as it was being a Canadian prime minister. And that has risks.

What does this mean for progressivism and more specifically conservatism in Canada? Should they also be trying to, you know, the next conservative leader pushing the envelope for what it means on visuals, on youth, on vibrancy? What should they be doing? Yeah,</div>

You tackle the apartheids of the world. You tackle social inequality, injustice, racism, all of that. As you get a little older, your universe shrinks a bit. You start thinking about the problems a little bit closer to home until ultimately you sort of hit the point where you&#39;re like, I just want my home rental to go okay, right? And that is where the conservatives&#39; bread and butter has been, right? Those pocketbook issues that like that practical, I just need X. And if I can get care of X, you know, that&#39;s great.

They&#39;re flaky. You know, they are thinking big when we&#39;ve got to be taking care of the small. And the conservatives were the sensible people. I remember hearing once in the 2000 election that George W. Bush was successful relative to Al Gore because Al Gore reminded you of your first husband and George W.

If it turns out that it&#39;s 10.4 though, I will say this.

            <div class="said">damn it, Zane. I don&#39;t want to answer what I&#39;m looking forward to because this makes me sound like an ass. But I&#39;m actually – I&#39;m anticipating something horrible at a Trump rally in the next seven to ten days. And I don&#39;t want to sound like I&#39;m looking forward to it. I&#39;m not. I just think that it&#39;s the natural progression of what&#39;s going to happen.</div>

            <div class="said">Fantastic point. I like that. Corey? Yeah. Um, I think that tomorrow is going to tell us a lot. If Donald Trump at the end of this manages to pull out, you know, most of those states, then I revise all my previous answers. Trump&#39;s going to be the guy, it&#39;s going to happen and all that. But I just, this has been a weird week. And I have a hard time believing that his rallies being shut down, some of his remarks in the wake of that, that that&#39;s not going to have at least a bit of an impact. and you combine that with some strategic voting some people who are really scared about Trump I</div>
