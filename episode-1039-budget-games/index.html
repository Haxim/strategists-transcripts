        <p>In the lead up to the 2023 Alberta election, Annalise, Stephen and Corey discuss today's provincial budget and yesterday's federal health deal - and what it tells us about UCP and NDP message tracks. Plus: we go deep on Stephen Carter's "For You Page".</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk discuss Alberta's pre-election budget and what it foreshadows about the provincial election. Will the budget land with Albertans? Have the UCP and NDP flipped sides on spending? And how long until Stephen Carter deletes TikTok "in solidarity with the federal government"? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote>

And it includes increased spending on a range of areas like healthcare, education, police, and even the Premier&#39;s own office budget. So lots to discuss. I know both of you have many, many thoughts. Let&#39;s dive in and let&#39;s just start at the big picture. Carter, what is your overall reaction to the budget? And I think it&#39;s worth noting the UCP, you know they&#39;ve been leaking out tidbits of budget stuff for weeks was today&#39;s budget what you expected it would be well</div>

Instead, it&#39;s a $5 million study into a blue line expansion, you know, on a project that is actually quite a ways down the capital list of things that need to happen in the city of Calgary.

Um, I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s necessarily a project that needed to be done, but you know, there was a lot of pressure from the folks in the North to do that. Um, you know, small projects. I mean, the Deerfoot was one of the largest, uh, at, uh, 300 million or something along those lines. Well, that&#39;s not even an interchange really. I mean, like on the Deerfoot, it&#39;s, it&#39;s a significant project to, to redo, uh, what we used to call the Deerfoot squeeze, right? The, the extra lane that just kind of disappears at Glenmore. This isn&#39;t going to do it. It&#39;s just simply not going to do it, not to the standards of today&#39;s road construction. So what did we get? What are the things that people are going to be talking about at the water cooler tomorrow? Because they&#39;re certainly not going to be talking about the influx of funding to primary care or maybe the billion dollars in total spending that goes to healthcare. But I don&#39;t even think that Because I think the billion dollars that&#39;s being spent in health care is actually, you know,</div>

          <div class="said">So it&#39;s interesting, because I agree with Stephen, when you look at it through like a capital projects lens, there&#39;s not the big splashy ticket items I would have expected going into an election election in Calgary, right? You know, normally, when you think of election budgets, you think of big projects, people are going to talk about shovels in the ground kind of stuff there. And in that sense, it&#39;s really not. Stephen&#39;s right, the amount of money put into these projects, relatively modest compared to the cost of these projects. The blue line one was interesting. So that&#39;s the spur line that would go to the airport on Calgary&#39;s northeast LRT line. And as Stephen even said like not actually that high on the capitalist this is kind of a growing trend in governments for them to kind of ignore the people they&#39;re funding and just pick the thing that they want to do no matter where it is on the list i think in the 90s we got into this idea of lists and we wanted transparency and lists and that grew in credence over decades people seem to have just walked away from</div>

          <div class="said">entirely and gone into kind of this pork barrel approach again that was more popular before that but you know let&#39;s step outside of capital for a minute because for me the operating budget was more interesting. And in an operating sense, I don&#39;t feel like it was a Kenny budget at all. You know, the budget, it does come, you know what I thought it was? I thought it was a PC budget. I thought it was a PC election budget. And I thought, oh, I guess we&#39;re doing this again, right? Where we reduce, we reduce, reduce, and it&#39;s an election year. And let&#39;s slap 5% into that, 5% into that, 5% into that, and claim the good times are back again. And that That was really interesting to me.

          <div class="said">I guess just to back up a bit, talk to me about what the strategy here going into an election is, right? Like we know budgets are important. Budgets in Alberta before elections are important. We all know what happened after Jim Prentice&#39;s tough times budget in 2015. So if you were advising, what&#39;s your strategy unveiling a budget when there&#39;s this huge huge surplus, and oil&#39;s doing great, and we have an election in, you know, red drop in two months. What should be the strategy?</div>

            <span class="ts">8:54</span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">Yeah. So the strategy has, I think, over time morphed. Like when you look at old budgets, they&#39;re fiscal documents, that&#39;s it, right? But somewhere along the way, people have come to the realization that money&#39;s pretty useful when you&#39;re trying to get people to get excited about things. So what happens now with the budget is it&#39;s the event, it&#39;s today, but of growing importance are the days around the event. So we&#39;ve seen an awful lot of pre-budget leaks this time around. That&#39;s gone on forever. But, you know, what we used to do is we used to just give it to the media and like it would be in a Don Brady column all of a sudden, like we hear this money is coming, right? Right. What we&#39;ve seen this time is actual government boards announcing money like board like social media boards announcing money before that money&#39;s been announced in the legislature, which is arguably not even allowed. Right. Yeah. But we&#39;re seeing more of that. You&#39;re also going to see over the next bit. I am sure of it.</div>

          <div class="said">Governments use this money to control the agenda, I guess, is the point I want to make.

          <div class="said">you&#39;re going to have an announcement a day of money for various interests not even so much because of the value of the money although that&#39;s obviously there and the stakeholder group you know, enthusiasm will follow, but because it controls the narrative, it controls the agenda and the conversation, and it keeps the opposition responding to good news government announcements instead of trying to drive their own agenda. So that&#39;s the real value of the budget. It&#39;s not so much that it&#39;s a set piece today, it&#39;s that it signals spending season. And as a result, it signals, you know, a season where government really gets to control the agenda more than they they do in the rest of the year.</div>

Bottom line, this is the beginning of the end of the oil and gas money. And when you&#39;re getting 20 plus billion, I think it was 26 billion, almost 27 billion in royalties right now, that is oh it is very nearing 50 of spending right</div>

But I&#39;ll say from a strategy point of view, what I find really interesting is that this particular budget is exactly what Stephen said. It&#39;s a big spending budget. It is $68 billion spending budget. That number boggles my mind. I remember when we were flirting with $50 billion and thinking, oh my lord you know 55 billion jesus that&#39;s a lot of money 68 boom like that and the debt actually does not go down over the next four years the debt is held constant in this budget despite the despite the small surpluses that are going forward and we&#39;ve basically taken a line that we used to mock other provinces for doing which is like well but our debt to gdp ratio is okay yeah</div>

But it is a far cry from that, you know, conservative battle cry of, of reducing debt and the ills of debt. And if this is truly the last oil boom, this does nothing to structurally change our finances. And that&#39;s really interesting.</div>

But what I think is interesting about this, and Corey&#39;s talked about this a number of times over the years, is that budgets are a communications document. And what I want to understand from this document is what is the communication through line? There is an increase of almost a billion dollars in public safety spending, almost all of which is going to, it appears, the sheriffs and public spending. You know, this is something that&#39;s going to be uh, addressed in the future. Um, this is the first step towards a provincial police force, right? Like they are, they are taking the first step towards a provincial police force and they are doing it not in the small towns, uh, that we kind of imagined it to be, but instead we&#39;re starting to see provincial police forces in our large cities. Um, and this is something that we, you know, I don&#39;t think anybody was really expecting, uh, was to see that this deployment would happen in in our big cities first this is this is a very interesting strategy because I&#39;m not sure that you get the big bump that you would have gotten from spending you know a lot more money on public safety in rural areas where this is a much bigger issue than spending it in downtown Calgary because downtown Calgary they&#39;ve got a billion dollar hole on on their downtown downtown revitalization not one penny went to it last year was only five million dollars it was laughable but last year was five million dollars more than this year uh an absolute joke in terms of what they&#39;re spending in the downtown core so i&#39;m just like how do you expect to clear up the</div>

The media, the pundits, the observers, they&#39;re all calling this a big spending budget. But when you look at it, when you dig into it, what are they spending it on? How are Albertans actually going to feel the difference in their own pocketbooks? Because there&#39;s not very much new here. and having run an election in 2012 on not very much new here in a budget i can tell you that is a fucking nightmare to be in we wound up basically throwing away our budget document and starting to spend money willy-nilly uh in order to try and win back the public&#39;s attention uh because the public wasn&#39;t paying attention to our budget document because there was nothing to pay attention to so</div>

Like, there&#39;s more to come. We already know there&#39;s this idea of an Alberta fund, which has money set aside for next fiscal. i&#39;m i&#39;m baffled from an accounting treatment how it works i i need to dig into it more perhaps the budget documents say it but they&#39;re they&#39;re clearly trying to find money and put money aside for things to come and they always do going into an election because they want to be able to announce things so there&#39;ll be there&#39;ll be pots of money either the surplus that&#39;s unspent or dollars that are unallocated with that they can then build into these announcements going forward and be able to say and by the way this is our there&#39;s room for it it&#39;s funded it&#39;s already good And that is increasingly what people do going into an election here, right? They identify blocks of dollars and they try to control the agenda going forward. We haven&#39;t seen the full budget yet. The legislature won&#39;t even see the full, I mean, they&#39;ll see the full legal budget, but they&#39;re not going to see the full consequences of that budget. This budget undoubtedly has been built with consideration that a general election is coming. And because one is, they&#39;re not going to put everything in the budget, right? They&#39;re going to hold a few things back. And I think you can expect that at least a few big ticket items are still to come. Let</div>

          <div class="said">Well, so there&#39;s the operating budget, you know. So I think the, let&#39;s put it this way. Carter&#39;s point about, like, it&#39;s all the money cannot be overstated here. Like $68 billion is an unfathomable amount of money. That&#39;s basically the same amount of money as like IBM globally spends in a year, right? Like that&#39;s, government is a huge part of our life. And we forget that, right? Like $68 billion is mental amounts of money. And so, you know, there&#39;s all sorts of opportunities that you can sprinkle in within there. But it is anchored by a bunch of really big, really expensive rocks, education, healthcare, like the delivery of those services. And I think that Stephen&#39;s right, like it goes up 5%. That&#39;s a tough budget to sell. That&#39;s not very interesting. That&#39;s just operating money 5%. But the sale is maybe not the point. Maybe it&#39;s defensive on that stuff. Those big rocks are defensive. But I have to imagine there&#39;s a few billion dollars that are there to allow them to do things that they want to do in the next election.</div>

And the peril, the cautionary tale of the NDP years is we didn&#39;t take care of the economy. And then look what had to happen in all of these spending programs. Now, of course, like they&#39;re the ones who did those actions. So it&#39;s a bit ridiculous. But that&#39;s going to be a line that has some currency with Albertans. And it does allow them to speak in their message box about economy. And you want to know one of the most baffling things about today&#39;s budget. It&#39;s just the most baffling from my point of view, is that the UCP stood up there and invested a pile of money into social services and talked about that all day. And the NDP attacked them for it being a big spending budget, you know, most expensive summer ever coming. You know, that&#39;s really weird to me because it seems like both of them were in the other person&#39;s message box. So, like, what do you make of that? Yeah,</div>

And when you look at polling, starting up your own police force doesn&#39;t have that much positivity. One thing that has gone kind of unnoticed is that the government of Alberta did give, I think it was $16 million or something like that, to the city of Grand Prairie to start their own municipal police force. Well, you know, Surrey just went that way and they&#39;re switching back to the RCMP, or at least they&#39;re trying to. this is a expensive venture and i think that cities and provinces that try this venture are going to find themselves spending a hell of a lot more money so again this this is an opportunity to talk about you know we you know obviously in the ndp war room i&#39;d be saying we want to keep spending you know</div>

Like, yeah, there was. And again, see my previous framing about, because we couldn&#39;t afford it because of the NDP&#39;s economic mismanagement, but we&#39;re out of that woods now.
