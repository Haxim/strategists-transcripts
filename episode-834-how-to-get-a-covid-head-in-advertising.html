        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter unpack government COVID advertising, future federal carbon tax hikes and the Georgia special elections. Does the gang love Alberta's "Covid Loves"? Can Trudeau sell $170/tonne? And most importantly, what is so bad that it has to be censored on THIS podcast?

Corey, we are starting in Alberta with a story about a campaign here that has gone national in many ways. And we start here with the Alberta government has tried to use humor with a new edgy campaign called COVID Loves. It has an eggnog slurping social distance violator named Mr. COVID Head as part of this $2 million campaign by the government of Alberta to try to influence behavior during the holiday season. I want to do two things in this segment. Number one, I want to talk about government communications campaigns. And Corey, we&#39;ve got you here to kind of help us tease out what exactly happens. I also then want to get the political side of that. And then I want to talk more specifically about this campaign. So let&#39;s start more generally. And Corey, I want to start with you. This is a campaign that has been sponsored, paid for, sourced out by the government of Alberta. And it&#39;s one of several campaigns that the government, I imagine, runs on a yearly basis, tackling many different items. Take us through where these campaigns originate, how they kind of work on the inside, how they get sourced out, and what are you kind of looking for in terms of success? What does success look like when you set out one of these campaigns as a former head of communications for the province here?</div>

          <div class="said">Well, the first thing you got to keep in mind is that government communications is a vast operation. Government communications is a bit like an iceberg. You see all of this communication that touches on the political issues of the day above the waterline, but the majority of communications that happens in government is below the waterline. and the government of Alberta has a fairly sophisticated operation for dealing with those campaigns some of it is done in-house some of it is outsourced it depends on both capacity and the nature of the communications that&#39;s going on it&#39;s true of every government to a certain extent some have more in-house capacity than others um this this looks like it was outsourced to me just based on what I know of the government&#39;s communications apparatus but why I mentioned this is that these campaigns are constantly being generated and every now and then one of those ones that&#39;s below the waterline that&#39;s created outside of any kind of political</div>

Very similar creative ideas have gone on for things like – it got everything from gonorrhea to you name it. Alberta actually tends to have some pretty interesting, pretty edgy public service announcement communications here. Now, what&#39;s interesting about that is that is not government&#39;s strong foot, generally speaking. And I think that&#39;s part of why you have a conversation that&#39;s going on here. A lot of people want government communications to be very straight up, have no edge whatsoever. That&#39;s not always the best way to hit the audiences that you&#39;re trying to hit when you&#39;re a communicator. So there&#39;s a bit of a tension there that government communications is always trying to walk, particularly when you&#39;re trying to talk to the youths, you know, younger demographics.

They&#39;ve created a website, site. They have asked for our interaction. So they have put together an engagement structure. The word engagement can never be spoken enough in government communications. It is, we must engage the population. That engagement is often a facade, but nonetheless, it is an important element.

Now, the audience&#39;s expectations are not the only input here, right? So even if we could very cleanly say this demographic wants us to communicate in this fashion, we also have to weigh that against our expertise as communicators. So there&#39;s communications best practice, and we know being clear and relevant matters. So we don&#39;t want to use a lot of $20 words. We don&#39;t want to sound too officious. We know that has a serious effect on remembering these things. And then, of course, there&#39;s the expectations of our bosses and the minister&#39;s office or the premier&#39;s office, depending on the actual campaign.</div>

But you get the, you know, despite that being called communications and public engagement, Public engagement is something that is broadly shared with a lot of different departments, and you&#39;re going to have a lot of people in departments say, no, I want to ask that question. No, I want to ask that question. Let&#39;s just layer in one more question. And you&#39;re going to similarly get helpful input on those lines from minister&#39;s offices and perhaps even the premier&#39;s office.

You know, knowing your experience, walk our listeners through perhaps how this campaign got through. Do you feel like it&#39;s a decision that was made at the public service level, ultimately, where a recommendation was made? Like just even maybe not even on this campaign, like how does this process work? Like, at some point, does the the public service as comms experts say we&#39;ve decided on edgy we decided on familiar here&#39;s what we think here&#39;s our justification why who do they kind of sell and pitch that to i&#39;m kind of curious or does an agency pitch the public the cp office just give me a sense of what that looks like because i&#39;m curious myself well</div>

And I think that&#39;s a legitimate criticism. Although I do think it still elevates, you know, I saw people saying, well, it&#39;s talking about the problem, but everybody knows COVID is a problem. So is it actually any good? I think it actually does a pretty good job of talking about the problems inherent in social gatherings through that creative that I talked about there. But to sort of answer your question, and Zane as to what are some of the challenges there. It&#39;s like, if you put this out, it will be under a magnifying glass. You know, the edgier you are, the bigger you are, the bolder you are, the more you&#39;re going to invite criticism, even if it&#39;s awesome, just more eyeballs are going to mean more feedback.

But from your perspective, any risks or liabilities with something right here. And I&#39;m not getting it a second guess. What I also feel like putting my cards on the table is a very well done campaign, both from a creative perspective and knowing how hard it is to get something like this to stand on its feet, the work that was required here and the sense of imagination. So I don&#39;t want you to second guess the creative professionals who put this together. But from like the strategy here, is there a risk that you feel like either on on efficacy or it might working or backlash or anything else that you feel like um could be warranted or could be necessary to put out on the table well</div>

We&#39;ve seen the website. We&#39;ve seen the initial two videos. Let&#39;s do a bit of free advice time, right? What would you do next? What would your next phase of this be? What would you kind of suggest the next – either the next messaging beat or the next piece of creative or elevation? Now seeing how it&#39;s gone, what would you kind of throw out there? And I&#39;m sorry for putting you on the spot, but I&#39;m just really curious if you&#39;ve got any suggestions or ideas. And Carter, over to you after that.</div>

          <div class="said">maybe it&#39;s not a complete campaign Yet, maybe it&#39;s the start of a great campaign. And there needs to be a little bit more on, you know, downstream. So so retargeting advertising, perhaps is already part of it. But if not, they should consider that they should absolutely consider bulking up the web content and making it more explicit as to what you are supposed to do, and being much more clear on that.

          <div class="said">Fully develop the voice would be what I would suggest. And the voice has been articulated a little bit, but I think that we could develop the voice a lot more. And the example I&#39;ll give to this is Banff Squirrel. That used to be the voice for Banff tourism, Banff Lake Louise tourism. And it took a while. You remember the squirrel ran in front of a camera and was caught in this picture. And they developed that voice as one of their primary voices for tourism in Banff Lake Louise. It took time. But the voice that we&#39;re seeing in the website is just but one opportunity. Developing the Facebook profile, developing a Twitter profile that enabled them to share, Snapchat, Instagram.</div>

Corey, we have to talk about evaluation. and measuring success on something like this. You brought up the other campaign that has found a moment of virality, I believe, even close to a decade ago in Alberta, which was the Plenty of Cif campaign, right? And that one, as we learned from the results of the campaign, had tremendous sort of efficacy, and it seemed to quote unquote work during the eight weeks of the campaign. But as soon as the ad spend ran dry, we kind of had a period where syphilis rates went back up, that the calls to get more information went down so how are you kind of judging success for something like this knowing that yes it&#39;s got a budget yes that budget seems healthy but when the ad span runs out is the campaign dead like what are you kind of looking at in terms of sustainability here well</div>

That&#39;s not actually telling you if you&#39;re changing amongst your target demographic opinions in the way that you want to have it done. So that&#39;s, that&#39;s the important thing for a campaign like this. And the other thing is, it takes an awful lot of rigor to set some metrics and objectives ahead of time. And And they should have certainly have polled on this, and I suspect they have because of the nature of the issue, COVID, in advance to see what the yardstick was then and see how much they&#39;ve moved that yardstick over the course of the campaign. There&#39;ll always be a lot of confounding variables. There&#39;ll be many things going on, but you ultimately have</div>

You know, my big push, and I&#39;m a broken record on this, is you make these campaigns sustainable by finding a small group of people who want to keep pushing them out beyond the ad spend, right? So, you know, we&#39;ve talked about it last week on the vaccinations, which is the same philosophy here, right? Whether it&#39;s this particular campaign or this particular issue of how big the problem is, finding groups of folks that want to fan that out and ensure that they&#39;ve got the toolkit to be able to do that. what&#39;s the equivalent for this campaign to carter&#39;s vaccination selfie and portfolio that you get right like what is the group of people that might be able to kind of fan this out so that&#39;s just top of my head thinking carter anything to add to either what i said or cory said did</div>

I&#39;m going to move it on to our next segment, the resistance to the resistance. Guys, we&#39;re going from Alberta, we&#39;re going to the federal side of things where this week, Ottawa is to hike the carbon tax to $170 a ton by 2030 in a surprise announcement made by the Trudeau government. government. Simultaneously, they&#39;re promising an additional $15 billion in new spending on climate initiatives over the next 10 years, money earmarked for improvement to the country&#39;s electrical vehicle infrastructure, rebates and tax write-offs to zero-emission vehicles, home retrofits—we&#39;ve seen this story before, somewhat here in Alberta a bit—as well as other proposed policies, including even helping the oil and gas economy. Guys, let&#39;s start with the very top line. And Carter, I want to start with you. What do you make of this announcement that was was put on the table by Trudeau. Some may call it a surprise announcement. How dare he do anything that is not COVID-related during the pandemic? A, what did you make of the timing? And B, what did you make of the message? The lead for Trudeau, at least the lead he wanted, was it&#39;s time to put money back in Canadians&#39; pockets when they need it the most.

          <div class="said">Corey, what&#39;s the O&#39;Toole strategy here? Are you embracing this as a principled conservative? Can you? Are you trying to fight it as nothing more than a tax grab? Knowing that you have to win the same swing regions that the liberals are going to compete for in an election as soon as this spring, what is your strategy and what is your play on something like this? Especially considering O&#39;Toole, you know, as part of his true blue conservatism, whatever that means, hasn&#39;t necessarily rejected, you know, carbon pricing or any sort of regulations on carbon as being part of his plan. What are you doing if you&#39;re him?</div>

I think that&#39;s an open question to me, but it&#39;s an important question because if people perceive the rebates as being bigger than the price, that means the higher this tax goes, the bigger your rebate gets. Actually, the more politically advantageous it is for Trudeau. Now, there may be a breaking point on that, but it effectively says, well, your checks are going to get bigger and bigger the larger we make this carbon tax, so why not go through the ceiling? You do it in an incremental sense so you don&#39;t feel like all of a sudden you go to the gas station and it&#39;s $2.50 a litre. I know that&#39;s not anywhere near what we&#39;re talking about here. We&#39;re talking about about 40 cents a litre. But the idea is you could take an incrementalism up and as long as those rebates keep going, my God, by the end, you&#39;ve basically got a UBI. Life is so good. Why not do it, right?</div>

And I want to to talk about some of the politics that are in play. There&#39;s two basic threads. Well, there&#39;s three because of, you know, if we&#39;re covering the US bucket in one because of the insanity that&#39;s happening in DC right now. Let&#39;s hold that off till the end of this segment. Let&#39;s start with two things. I want to start with the politics in Georgia right now. And Stephen, I want to go to you because I know you&#39;ve got the Stephen Carter tried, tested and true political handbook for the holidays. And this is what I find to be interesting from a political strategy perspective. So to fill Fill our listeners in, you know, Stephen, in your 2010 campaign for Mayor Nenshi here, that come from behind victory, you had that guidebook for what people need to do during the holidays when they gather, how they talk about a campaign, not dissimilar to how one may talk about a vaccine or the COVID problem, right? Making the most engaged, super engaged about a particular issue. Knowing that the holidays are going to look very different in Georgia right now, I&#39;m asking you to give almost be like a drone style analysis of where the terrain is and what you would recommend to the two Georgia candidates in terms of their strategy for the holidays? What are you looking to do? What are you not looking to do knowing the new limitations that you have? And I&#39;m asking you to do this top of your head. So I appreciate that. But lay it on me. What do you think? Well,</div>

          <div class="said">you know this is very interesting and a great segue to my second point that i want to bring up because on thursday a group of uh progressive Democrat coalition movements, Justice Democrats, Sunrise Movement, Data for Progress, put out this really interesting memo in Georgia, which said that the Democrats in Georgia should run on a national $1,200 check campaign for the Georgia Senate, ultimately concluding that Biden can strengthen his call for $1,200 stimulus checks if Republicans block them now. This is for the Senate. So what&#39;s on the line is $1,200 for you, quite literally. The memo then suggested that Ossoff and Warnock should announce their support for these stimulus checks that Biden would be pushing. And this would actually be the pathway towards victory. They kind of had polling that said 63% of likely Georgia runoff voters said they&#39;d be more likely to support a candidate who supports these relief checks. Almost putting your point into practice, Corey, right? This is a national race. Let&#39;s put the national import of $1,200 stimulus checks into the hands of Georgians to decide for their fellow countrymen of 300 plus million. Carter, to your point, good strategy, bad strategy. What do you think? This is clearly a group that comes from the more left wing of the Democratic Party. We&#39;ve talked about kind of that patching and that bridge that needs to be built. But what&#39;s your take on this? Like, what&#39;s your gut feel on? Is this a good idea? Is this something that they should perhaps embrace and inherit as part of their last leg heading into this January runoff? This</div>

I mean, it&#39;s 70th plus percentile. Why this particular $1,200 check issue? To me, it looks to me like a group that was advocating for a specific thing found that the specific thing could be successful in this election. What it doesn&#39;t tell you is where is the ranking of that particular issue, right?</div>

But it puts pressure on the leadership from the base who will start saying, why aren&#39;t you doing this and start panicking? We could win the election if you just did this. And it&#39;s that internal pressure that actually gets delivered by this poll, not changes of opinion directly. Correctly. Nobody in Joe Biden&#39;s office is going to look at that and say, well, $1,200 checks done, stamp, we&#39;re going to do that. So it&#39;s a bit of an internal campaign as well, I guess is what I would say. It&#39;s not even targeted towards Republicans or the general population.

I remember, Carter, you and I discussing this when I was helping out on the last Merrill campaign here, being like, just do this. This could work, right? Like you&#39;re thinking about, you know, in this close fight, how to ultimately win. Everything seems to be on the agenda. If you&#39;re running these campaigns, you might kind of feel like you&#39;re Bambi on ice, not exactly sure what to do when.

If there&#39;s been one area that&#39;s been falling down, perhaps it&#39;s the Georgia Senate elections. But I think overall, his his announcements and his his push, his governance, the way he looks like a normal president. I think that all of that just helps. We will see. But I&#39;m thinking that he&#39;s helping Georgia turn blue and his announcements have been super strong.

On a one to 10 scale, the political strategy and messaging of Trudeau, taking a picture of the planes that landed today with the vaccines, having the Minister Anand go there as well, kind of almost like similar to that video that we saw here in Alberta, where Jason Kenney was sending off masks to other jurisdictions. This, of course, is having the minister receive the doses of vaccine, the imagery, the messaging, the distribution of that. What do you give that on a one to 10 on the political strategy or campaign strategy scale?</div>

And then, of course, ensure that the most meta project that the strategists have taken on is also fulfilled at tiny.cc slash Dave Berta. Fill out question six. Fuck all the other questions. Who cares? Number six, us having the survey win is the political play of the year. If you don&#39;t get it, doesn&#39;t matter. Just do it. And with that, we&#39;ll wrap episode 834 of The Strategist. My name is Zane Velji. With me, as always, Corey Hogan, Stephen Carter, and we&#39;ll see you next time.</div>
