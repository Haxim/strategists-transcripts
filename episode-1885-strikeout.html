I&#39;ve got a number in mind. in terms of how many seats they</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, it depends on the combination in terms of being actually to be able to make change around a city council table. First of all, a mayor is only one vote for starters. And if you can get the right combinations in place, you can actually get stuff done. At least that&#39;s what I&#39;m told. I&#39;m not much for potable politics myself, but municipal doesn&#39;t really get me up in the morning.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">It seems like it&#39;s getting no one up in any morning leading up to</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">to the election. Everyone is very tired on this one. Is that actually what you&#39;re, like, is that your universe too, in terms of, like?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">yeah, certainly I&#39;ve, you know, I&#39;ve been kind of watching what&#39;s happening in Calgary. Like, nobody has really, you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">you know, gotten excited about one candidate or another. Nope. I think it might be starting to happen a little bit in Edmonton. It looks like the progressive universe is understanding the assignment in Andrew Knack, Apogast, Tim Cartmell. I&#39;m seeing a little of that congealed. I&#39;m certainly not seeing it in Talgary at all, right? So there&#39;s no, there doesn&#39;t seem to be, with the exception of Ferkis, and I would say Sonia Sharpe is probably doing this too into the conservative universe, but they&#39;re not anchoring back</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">back to pre-existing social networks or relational, right? Right.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">And so that&#39;s what I&#39;m seeing. And of course, down here in Lethbridge, we don&#39;t really have a mayor&#39;s race. The incumbent, as unfortunate as he is, doesn&#39;t really have a challenger. But there&#39;s lots going on in the council space. So that&#39;s good. And maybe we can get another woman or two on council. That&#39;d be nice. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I hear you on all of those points, including the fact that these pre-existing networks are not coming together in a unified way to, A, have the same perspective or an aligned perspective and B, do the work to make sure others around them know of that. I&#39;m not seeing really any of that happening. And we&#39;re</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">we&#39;re like, we&#39;re in advanced vote period right now. Like you could advance vote in Calgary right now. And I know many</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">many folks, like, let me give you an anecdote. This is why I find this interesting, because I&#39;ve been trying to figure out for a while why this is such a sleepy election. In fact, I&#39;ve had people ask me, like, who should we vote for? What&#39;s going on? And I&#39;m in a text group of, you know, center left to progressive people. In that group for all Calgarians, there&#39;s probably four mayoral candidates people support of varying viability. But I think that&#39;s also part of the question is that no one really has a sense of who&#39;s viable in this election. No one knows if we have enough runway here for any of the candidates that are polling in single digits to make a breakthrough when half the city is undecided and the leader is at 16%, give or take, depending on which poll is your variety. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, your preferred poison, yeah. But then I think it&#39;s also this broader aspect of what</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">what you put on the table, maybe inadvertently, that I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t know if city issues are moving anyone when the province</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">is disrespecting the city, just can railroad quite literally whatever they want. The Green Line here in Calgary is a great example. Be like, this is what we want. Who cares? Like, your council is a pet project for us. And I think some of that negative partisanship against municipal politics, maybe not even against the politicians themselves and where they stand, is starting to pay dividends,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">dividends, is not the right word, but is starting to see its consequences in terms of an extremely sleepy election in both jurisdictions where, frankly, yes, Josie Gondek is running again, but you can classify both of them as largely open races, per se, because she doesn&#39;t seem to want to necessarily defend her past or doesn&#39;t seem to have the incumbent advantage. It&#39;s a weird and wild sort of state of play with 12 days to go and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">and no one wanting to choose to vote early, at least in the groups that I&#39;m in. Everyone&#39;s like, I&#39;m going to hold off to see if something happens so that I know what to do because the signals aren&#39;t out there yet.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">you know i&#39;ll go back to an example right one of the things that johnster would talked about with the daily show is that one of the reasons it worked for the population that it targeted when it did was that it was a commentary show where they would not spoon-feed you the context. They already relied on, the assumption was, that if you were watching the show, you would have the context in order to engage with it deeply. And over the 25 years or 20-some years since that comment was made, that still seems to be the case with that format. The problem with that format is that without legacy media and without people having a baseline understanding of what&#39;s going on, they can&#39;t patch into it. So what we are seeing the rise of is people like us, Like even folks that are</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">are great talkers on TikTok, on Instagram, have been campaign volunteers, have do political commentary. You may have never seen them on a major news network, and arguably they&#39;re better, more educated, have a more dedicated audience than</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">those folks that do, you know, present company included in some ways. And they&#39;re talking to a base of people. I forget the gentleman&#39;s name, but he&#39;s been fantastic on The Teacher Strike, which we&#39;ll get to in a second. I said Cole, and I apologize. I&#39;m sure people listening will know his name. But I see them all the time on Instagram, on Reels, getting several thousand hits. But the fact is, I think there&#39;s more content than ever before for the hyper-engaged. And we are part of that machinery. Like our content, like, you know, to make this meta is for the hyper-engaged, is for folks that are either already engaged, know the baseline effects. I mean, our next topic is just, we&#39;re going to be talking about like the tactics of an ATA strike. Like, fuck, there&#39;s some people who woke up on Monday morning realizing that there was a strike. And here we are making political content for a very sub-genre. But that level of content has increased significantly. It is</span>

But we are a smaller and smaller group. Maybe. I don&#39;t know if we are. I would want to test that. I think we are. are uh based on what we&#39;re seeing in the municipal election i would say that we might be yeah</span>

            <span class="text">the last half decade politics has become culture so when we started this podcast you know 10 years ago the idea that we would take politics and use it like a sports talk format was novel it&#39;s no longer novel because Because politics is now part of culture and culture has like a more, I hate to kind of lowest common denominator approach in terms of language and vernacular. Like politics in both other countries, USA and Canada, has entered that space. So our format is no longer novel. You add on the algorithmic element to it. So talking in a snippy, plain spoken language about big topics is part of it. So you&#39;re having this content machine kind of being produced. I think there&#39;s more people than ever before paying attention to politics because it is culture. It&#39;s embedded in everything. It&#39;s embedded in their identity. It&#39;s embedded in how they consume music and sports. Let the launch of the Taylor Swift album earlier this week, you know, be split on partisan grounds. Has she gone mega as an entire subcultural conversation right now? Now, so politics, I think, is like how it&#39;s the prism we slice and dice everything through. But I think it has not translated, A,</span>

            <span class="text">um yeah yes so i agree and so we might be entering this political era in terms of content consumption where it&#39;s the richest it&#39;s the worst of times and it&#39;s the best of times if you&#39;re politically engaged you can find extremely niche things like our pod and other tiktok accounts and instagram accounts to fulfill your appetite on any political story of the day or of the hour really you can it exists yeah right yeah um yet there is very little of that baseline informing uh for for the folks that have kind of tuned out</span>

Like, we can go back to Charlie Kirk and TPA, but, you know, if Charlie Kirk&#39;s assassination wasn&#39;t the headline about TPA, it would be the business structure of TPA and their offline engagement. How they meet thousands of people, literally IRL. And we haven&#39;t actually adopted any of those pieces in a meaningful way, in a sustained way, at least in a modeled way that I can tell that allows progressives to organize. So, you know, there has been a cost to our moral outrage against big tech. Like, that&#39;s the point I&#39;m trying to make is that as we have left and had these breakups, we actually haven&#39;t poured it into an alternative place. Some might say blue sky, but I don&#39;t think it has critical mass yet. People can disagree with me on places, but I just don&#39;t think we have found our place to take a</span>

Because it&#39;s like a whole, you know, a couple blocks of schools over in that area of town. There&#39;s nobody there. And I&#39;m like, what the hell? So, you know, I&#39;m in the group chat. I&#39;m like, where are the pickets? And there aren&#39;t any. I just didn&#39;t put it together.

We are going to we&#39;re doing something like this is a last resort. I need that.

Are they helping you, Shannon Phillips, right, who&#39;s parenting kids right now? Is Ms. Johnson and or an equivalent, your kid&#39;s teacher, pushing stuff out there saying this is what you can do? I know the government&#39;s created a platform. Here&#39;s all the things we&#39;ve developed. Here&#39;s some of the stuff we&#39;re doing. a toolkit for teachers to frankly help that that longer standing empathy online not paid not advertised but covered ultimately when people word to mouth talk to each other be like fuck these teachers are awesome like despite these shitty conditions have you seen like there&#39;s this group where they&#39;ve set up a facebook group and they&#39;re like they&#39;re downloading curriculum materials for parents just to grab online or whatever or they&#39;re downloading something some element of teachers showing that we are here to help still in the micro then i need to see some</span>

And it&#39;s always the reset point, right? A spring campaign, it&#39;s often Easter or it&#39;s the May long. And it&#39;s kind of campaigns press reset set. And they&#39;re oftentimes going into the third period of the campaign, the kind of final throw. And it is the time in which you kind of expect that what the voters are doing is going kind of back to their family groups, their friend groups, their dinner tables, and kind of deciding what they&#39;re going to do and what the main messages are. That&#39;s how we kind of imagine it as campaign practitioners. This weekend is one of those times for the teachers. It&#39;s Thanksgiving. you i agree</span>

We&#39;re going to create, you know, we&#39;ve got all these teachers. The instruction that we&#39;re given is create one or two pieces. I know this sounds silly, but this is how we communicate these days. We&#39;ve just talked about why the Calgary election is so sleepy.

And the ATA should be taking lessons from that in some ways, which is that, yes, you started off at a beautiful visual high watermark and you have built in support, but people can just tune out. Like frog and boiling water syndrome is the half-life of that is increasing so quickly that people are just like, yeah, whatever. There&#39;s just a norm now. Teachers on strike. I mean, Shannon, we&#39;re just so used to fucking Canada Post not being a thing anymore. I don&#39;t even go to the mailbox. You know what I mean? I get home delivery. i used to go every day to see if i just don&#39;t do it anymore like i&#39;ve normalized my behavior fucking five days so the government risks we normalize our behavior so quick i mean the union i should say uh risks that we normalize our behavior so quickly here that we normalize reality so quickly and yes this is a pain to the 700 000 kids and their parents but frankly there&#39;s a group beyond that right that i think they will still need public sympathy for um because Because if this just becomes parents, then that number starts dwindling. And then I&#39;m curious if you think the math here just works for the ATA. As long as they hold the parents, no one else matters.

The government&#39;s going to make it about the small investments that they&#39;re making.

He was the president of the ATA at the time. That was also a gigantic rally on the steps of the legislature when they went out. It was not as big as the Iraq war, but close. And a very, very big protest. protests and Larry was absolutely everywhere in earned media right which was a different time he was a lot more uh I um as a a traditional union leader in that way of you know uh giving you know the sort of more soaring I treat unionist rhetoric you know Larry would go around like you know quoting Antonio Gramsci and uh</span>

Because what it does is it allows for the rank and file to fill the communications gap. And I think that&#39;s a good thing in this case. You want that. You don&#39;t want him to become a lightning rod, right? You notice us that the government hasn&#39;t really attacked him personally. They absolutely did that to Larry Boy back in the day, if I remember correctly.</span>

I hope certain things do change. I still feel like, you know, to your point, I agree with your assessment that parents are still very much on side. The public is still very much on side. I think the ATA needs to be careful, though, with the with the government that&#39;s trying to be so crisp and so lean in its messaging. And it might even sound crass in terms of how the government&#39;s messaging, but it is puncturing and piercing through, which is something to be said. Daniel Smith, though, Shannon, has not closed the door on back to work legislation.</span>

Does he go after EB on this to try to punch through? Does he propose a different pipeline plan if he has to respond to Danielle Smith? His current sort of messaging is broadly this is non-consultative. It&#39;s very much process-based. But in terms of where Nahid Nenshi goes, if pipelines do become the fight or do become the conversation topic, what advice would you want to give them?</span>

I think this is kind of a brilliant way out where, you know, Carney can say, yeah, fine, you know, we&#39;ll give you your pipeline. Once again, how much, like, so TMX had uplift for both Kennedy and Carney and specifically the Alberta Treasury, right? It is measurable. It is significant amounts of money. It is exactly what we said it was going to be. Thank you very much.</span>
