        <div class="desc"><p>The gang gets together to talk about the Patrick Brown campaign - what his moves are from here, the risks to the Conservative Party, what we know and what we don't know - before a quick trick across the Atlantic.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about continued fallout from the Patrick Brown disqualification and Boris Johnson's (delayed) resignation as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Has what we've learned in the last two days changed our opinions about the Brown DQ? Did Boris Johnson have the chance to hold on? And what qualifies as a dressing down in 2022? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>
