We were the first Canadian political podcast to provide people with the fresh, fresh Patrick Brown content. I mean, first and best. I mean, that&#39;s what we do.

            <span class="text">The first thing, of course, was Patrick Brown&#39;s strong defense, which we recommended on this podcast that he come out with a strong defense and he did a media blitz i don&#39;t think there was a media show that he could have been on that he wasn&#39;t on in the immediate aftermath of him sending out the statement um</span>

There&#39;s some holes in her story that I&#39;d still like to see kind of filled in, but it does look like it&#39;s building a new grave for Mr. Brown. And then, of course, the second piece, which was the leak out of the Conservative</span>
