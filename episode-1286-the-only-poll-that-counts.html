But Carter, what do you kind of look at that from a strategist perspective, when you see your competition effectively having, at least declared competition, having such an advantage on you in that regard?

Often, we don&#39;t have access to what Dan&#39;s providing us today. Just let&#39;s be totally clear. No, I mean, Stephen and I do all the time. You don&#39;t. You don&#39;t. You generally don&#39;t. It&#39;s new for you. People call us. I don&#39;t. You generally don&#39;t. No, no, they really don&#39;t, Carter. But you don&#39;t have a chance to often have the depth that you want in your question line, right? Let&#39;s just be totally honest for a second. Sometimes you pick up fragments because you don&#39;t have the budget, you don&#39;t have the expertise available on hand. You pick up fragments from an omnibus, for example, on familiarity, and you have to go with it. If you two were going simply on familiarity, and Dan, I&#39;ll get you to chime in on this on the back end. I&#39;ll ask Corey and Stephen first. First, if all you saw was what Dan lays out here in the familiarity numbers, how would you be starting to think of making a case here? Because you both say it&#39;s important, but not everything. Corey, if this is the only data point, how do you start slicing it from here?</span>

You need to understand, okay, these people know them. That actually affords us probably a better comfort that these numbers mean something thing once you actually get into those like what do you feel about the individual right pretty tough at four percent to say it means too much a lot easier to say at 80 if it means something right but let&#39;s put it this way familiarity is</span>

            <span class="text">to construct a story. I agree. Like, listen, I think one of the realities of somebody at the top of that list, like Danielle Smith or Rachel Notley, people feel things about them. They think they know them. They have opinions about them. And it&#39;s hard to change those sometimes. And, you know, the opportunity that some of the other candidates lower on the list have is they can craft the story for them and introduce themselves in a way that is advantageous for the thing they&#39;re doing right now. Right? Everything can be crafted for the thing they&#39;re doing right now in a way that more known commodities simply do not have available to them.</span>

Here&#39;s the problem that both Zane Velji and Sarah Hoffman have. have um and we didn&#39;t mention the the nench yet but his ratios like his ratios are pretty similar to the three or you know ganley and and uh pancioli as well right because they&#39;re basically two to one like to not right and what i think is really interesting about that is the person who&#39;s not like the others there and that&#39;s sarah hoffman who has the higher negatives there yeah</span>

And they don&#39;t kind of grow out of the ground, you know, just as water falls because the ground had seeds in them. You know, somebody&#39;s got to go and harness these memberships.

            <span class="text">how it generally happens is you have people who are leaders in communities or even people who just want to hustle who will go out and sell 10, 20, 30 memberships at a time. And, you know, those are not massive numbers, but in aggregate, if you&#39;ve got a good field campaign, that builds something. Takes time, takes a lot of effort, but ultimately those conversations on kind of the end of the fractals, which is actually kind of the bigger multipliers, right? right, where you&#39;ve managed to find 300 people who will go out and sell 10 memberships, right, or whatever, those tend to be more along the lines of, hey, Bob, you&#39;re a good friend of mine. Will you buy a membership and vote in this? Hey, Bob&#39;s wife, you&#39;re</span>

Hey, now that I think about it, Bob, don&#39;t you have a brother? Can&#39;t Bob, your brother, buy a membership as well? And so, So I think it&#39;s super interesting, but I think that memberships actually come from campaigns. And I don&#39;t mean to be kind of simple about that, but it</span>

That sticks out to me, because when you mentioned the vote field for Nenshia being like close to what, was it like 130,000, 140,000 for Racky and for Sarah, less than half of that at around 50-ish. And then for Hoffman, it&#39;s even lower, despite the fact that she&#39;s more well-known. And I think you talked about her negatives being higher. Is this a direct result of that, number one and then number two talk to me about if this if this surprised you then guys i&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have some comments around what this kind of means regarding her path and when i say guys i mean cory and steven thereafter yeah</span>

He was going in fourth place in ballots. ballots michael ignatyev didn&#39;t come back for you right he was sitting there at the top but he just couldn&#39;t get it done because races tend to generate these dynamics where people start to like if if you&#39;re not with the front runner you&#39;re probably never going to be with the front runner we talk about this all the time right and so those votes tended to coalesce and very few ended up leading to ignatyev relatively as as things went on there happens</span>
