        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about how we ended up at the impending collapse of Alberta's health care system, Premier Jason Kenney's bringing in a not-a-vaccine-passport vaccine passport and the effect of this drama on the federal campaign. Will Kenney's actions sink the O'Toole campaign? Does a bad Mulroney speech mark the Conservatives as "progressive"? And what's with Zain's awful press conference take? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

The government had ads everywhere and reduced the restrictions very rapidly after the end of the third wave, as we saw the number of cases declined sharply due to an increase Increase in vaccinations, the fact that we had masking, all of those good things that have kept us safe from COVID-19.

But the frustration is now businesses have to make the choice about which of their customers they want to antagonize. Obviously, the vast majority of Albertans are supportive of vaccine passports, 80% or so. But that 20% can be pretty loud and pretty annoying.

Maybe I&#39;ll clarify measures with a hundred dollar gift card. Now is introduced a blanket set of restrictions that go into effect on Monday. Announced them. Let&#39;s well, and we&#39;ll get to the timing in a second in the in the federal sort of election ramifications. Carter, let&#39;s stick to Alberta for now and talk about this a bit more. And for our listeners, maybe outside of the province, can you add the politics? Can you give us a sense of the politics of wanting to be the first to open, let&#39;s start where Corey started his story, all the way to perhaps the dithering and the lack of response and perhaps absence leading up to yesterday, which is still considered by many, based on other jurisdictions, a half measure.

He&#39;s a tin pot leader who, even today, even today on his Facebook Live, he&#39;s doing a Facebook Live where he&#39;s addressing all of the Albertans. And this is how he chooses to address us directly. And in the background of the shot, there&#39;s a victory Calgary stampede pennant.</div>

So give me your take. Do you agree with Carter that, and Carter, I know there was a very impassioned, you know, plea at the end. But the headline that, if I can summarize, was politics by ideology or governing by ideology. Corey, do you agree that that is what&#39;s led to wanting to be the first to open up, perhaps dithering and delaying, and seeing this pattern that we have seen with the premier now in our fourth province-wide state of health emergency?</div>

Walk me through with your Alberta political history and campaign strategy hat, knowing what, you know, broadly that UCP caucus looks like. What do you see from these restrictions?

It definitely feels like there are competing visions for what this should be that are resting within the policy that the government of Alberta threw out there, and they are trying to fix it with communications. And they have broken their brains in the process because none of it holds together anymore. And as they&#39;re talking about it, just this word salad ballot comes out and you know i guarantee you everybody who was watching the news conference yesterday would not know what the state of play was right now were it not for the fact that they could then go and look at a website after and try to decipher it and try to figure it out and i can guarantee that because they actually contradicted themselves at different points in it and we don&#39;t need to get into it but one of them was around distancing for example two meters was that just for the moment was that included in the vaccine thing a lot of a lot of unclarity on this ultimately what they brought out zane was</div>

They&#39;ve said, now we have all of these restrictions, but we have this restriction exemption program, which is, by the way, not a good name in addition to being confusing. It really sounds unsafe.

Let&#39;s go to today, because today, Jason Kenney&#39;s ramifications, the blast zone of Alberta in this election really made itself present. We talk about Alberta&#39;s impact being negligible with the seats that we have here. here. Carter, I think it&#39;s safe to say that Alberta&#39;s impact, as Corey has said many times on this podcast, and I believe you have as well, is less about the seats, more about the issues. And here we are, Carter, endgame, Aaron O&#39;Toole. Did Jason Kenney just play fuck his buddy to Aaron O&#39;Toole announcing this on a Wednesday night, digested by the entire country on Thursday? I look at National News Watch right now to what Corey pointed us to. Six stories at the top, Top five of them are about this province.

But either way, it was, it was comments that already didn&#39;t seem accurate. But it did seem that those comments were maybe based on stale data, because Alberta did really well in the first wave, especially relative to people dying in nursing homes in Quebec and in comparable situations. So I always felt like in some ways, Aaron O&#39;Toole needs to update his briefing materials more regularly when he made that comment. But the</div>

It makes them a little bit closer. And I&#39;m sure the liberals would really like a conflating of the two positions, right? And certainly Aaron O&#39;Toole has done everything to support that, up to and including not answering a question that was apparently asked of him 11 times it would be i think smart if he had said no i don&#39;t i made those comments at a very different time alberta did very well in the first wave right</div>

If Jason Kenney does not show up last night, Wednesday night, if Jason Kenney doesn&#39;t give that 6 p.m. news conference, if he just sits on his hands until Tuesday, says, fuck it, it&#39;s going to be the federal election, People in Alberta will be mad with me.

He would have put off the recovery for five or six days. But frankly, he&#39;s put off the recovery from this situation for over six weeks. He&#39;s put off the recovery from this since we all spotted that, hey, after Stampede, things don&#39;t look that good. And he declared that Stampede was great. I seem to recall Alberta Health Services and the people associated with, you know, health care in the province of Alberta saying the stampede was fine. We didn&#39;t have any problems with stampede. Well, OK, maybe the stampede was fine. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not here to I&#39;m not here to trace everything back. But it feels like things aren&#39;t great.

It seems like this question will keep dogging him. Like, if the national media is any indication uh o&#39;toole did cancel a one-on-one appearance with ctv uh and is refusing to reschedule there&#39;s rumors that he&#39;s hunkering down that he&#39;s turtling a bit that they might need to reset carter um this has not been a great week for him in in a few ways we&#39;re talking about this we&#39;re talking about uh you know picking this this this pc track which we&#39;ll talk about in a a second, that he is done.

What advice would you have for Trudeau going forward as it relates to this particular situation in Alberta? He can he just can&#39;t have a shit eating grin about it. But what does he need to do strategically as a team to try to leverage this, maximize it beyond what they&#39;ve done today, which is the tying of Kenny to O&#39;Toole, which seems to be the strategic pumping up of a George Shahal campaign video on Twitter where Shahal made the early days of the campaign tying Kenny to O&#39;Toole. And now it seems like strategically everyone in the liberal camp is pumping that video up. But outside of those couple of tactics, what does Trudeau need to do to sustain this connection, to sustain this story in the endgame heading into Monday?</div>

It does make sense to continue to try to draw Aaron O&#39;Toole to it, to highlight the fact that he doesn&#39;t even want to answer the questions about Jason Kenney. As long as Aaron O&#39;Toole continues to take the approach he took today, the Liberals have an opportunity on it.

Part of me feels like the NDs here in Alberta are almost kind of putting on the brakes. Like, let&#39;s be kind of gentle with Kenny. Let&#39;s not get to the point where we screw screw ourselves in 2023 by pushing them out. Now, this is just one man&#39;s interpretation of what I see. But what advice would you have for them, whether you acknowledge my point or not in your response, as they look at this moment, this critical moment, and we haven&#39;t talked a lot about the local politics for Kenny and his downfall, because I want to keep it federal.

You don&#39;t want to necessarily step in it, maybe be accused of cheering on the province having failure in the health care system. You don&#39;t want to be perceived as somebody who is just being too politically calculating on it. So maybe you just sort of step back a bit and take on more of the serious tone of, oh, my goodness, yes, it&#39;s a very difficult situation in Alberta. and so it&#39;s tough to assess the strategy in in this moment in isolation because of the seriousness of the moment right we&#39;ll get a better sense of it in the next couple of weeks couple of months because if the ndp continue to treat him with kid gloves like this i think it&#39;s an indication that they&#39;re actually worried that you know he&#39;s he&#39;s just swaying there and if they just give a light breeze in his direction he might fall on the mat have to deal with someone else carter</div>

Let&#39;s talk about the endorsements as well, because we got Kretchen endorsing Trudeau, Hazel McCallum endorsing Trudeau, and then quickly after when reporters find her saying, oh, we shouldn&#39;t be having this election. You had Mulroney, who&#39;s now endorsing O&#39;Toole. But let&#39;s talk about O&#39;Toole&#39;s endgame strategy here, Carter. Carter. He&#39;s picking the PC lane.

The truth of the matter is, there are more votes in the center than there is in the right. So you move to the center to pick up those votes. That&#39;s where the people are.

Right. The plan there absolutely is to say like, hey, this is totally cool. You should let me park here. But voters are leery. They&#39;re suspicious.
