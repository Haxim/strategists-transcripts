        <p>The gang headed up to Edmonton for a chat with 400 of their closest friends at the Maharaja Banquet Hall. There was music. There was fancy dress. There was analysis of the UCP leadership review results, Kenney's resignation and speculation about what comes next. There was a very long drink line. Only the third on that list is actually apparent in this audio file.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the Alberta UCP's leadership review Kenney's not-resignation resignation and what's next for the UCP in this live show recorded in Edmonton, Alberta. How did the UCP get to this point? Does Jason Kenney have a next act? And should we be concerned about that leak (from the ceiling above Zain's head)? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote><p>Our thanks to the Maharaja Banquet Hall, Ryan Sauvé, Zain Velji's tailor and the parents of our live studio audience, for this star-studded spectacle.</p>

You can jump on one of these campaigns or you can jump on right now and help us change this province for the better. And that organizer work, that can occur. And broadening the tent and involving more people and having meetings with bigger and bigger teams and empowering those teams to tailor locally the solutions they need, just as we always say we want people to be able to do with health care and with education and all of those things. true of politics as well, right? You&#39;ve got to be able to locally tailor your message and that requires local people with kind of a horse feel for the place, right? You can&#39;t run a campaign for Calgary from Edmonton, full stop. Just as we could not run a campaign for Edmonton from Calgary, full stop. Different cultural touchstones, just different things that go on. In terms of messaging, I don&#39;t have a, I don&#39;t have a severe reaction to what&#39;s, you know, what the NDP or, I don&#39;t think it was wise to release two news releases yesterday.
