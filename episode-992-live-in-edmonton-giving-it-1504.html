And there&#39;s two reasons that you don&#39;t immediately discount that. One is he has way better information than all of us. You have to assume his campaign is out there, is calling people, is polling people, is trying to understand how they feel about that. And yeah, people lie to the leader, but a smart leadership campaign is not going to say, hi,</span>

You can jump on one of these campaigns or you can jump on right now and help us change this province for the better. And that organizer work, that can occur. And broadening the tent and involving more people and having meetings with bigger and bigger teams and empowering those teams to tailor locally the solutions they need, just as we always say we want people to be able to do with health care and with education and all of those things. true of politics as well, right? You&#39;ve got to be able to locally tailor your message and that requires local people with kind of a horse feel for the place, right? You can&#39;t run a campaign for Calgary from Edmonton, full stop. Just as we could not run a campaign for Edmonton from Calgary, full stop. Different cultural touchstones, just different things that go on. In terms of messaging, I don&#39;t have a, I don&#39;t have a severe reaction to what&#39;s, you know, what the NDP or, I don&#39;t think it was wise to release two news releases yesterday. That, sure, that was weird. but I don&#39;t have such a severe reaction to the notion of trying to define your opponent at this time and remind everybody that it wasn&#39;t just one person it wasn&#39;t just Jason Kenney that entire caucus signed on to this platform and this platform has these components you&#39;ve got to keep that in mind but</span>
