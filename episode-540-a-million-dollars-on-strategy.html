            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think I&#39;d rather be Tom Mulcair because I&#39;m still not at all convinced that that this attack is going to register with Canadians. The problem, and I don&#39;t think the New Democrats should have done what they did, but the problem that the New Democrats have, or sorry, the Conservatives have, is that the number is so big. It&#39;s like $26 million. It is so big that people have a hard time swallowing it. They look at it and they go, really? They violated the law to the point where they spent $26 million, and I&#39;m just hearing about it for the first time. There&#39;s probably another side to this story. It&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, and I think that the amazing thing that they&#39;ve done, what they should have done, is never totaled it up. They should have gone, and they&#39;ve got this scrolling bars underneath their website, the CPC, the conservatives, where they actually show who owes how much. In terms</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">If it were me, I would have just focused on that because it is the glass of orange juice that kills you. right the 18 dollar glass of orange juice kills you 2.7 million or 26 million to you know the idea to corey&#39;s point the idea is that when the numbers get bigger it loses its meaning</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s not even possible for you to attain in corey&#39;s case 27 million and others 2.7 you just lose sight of it but</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">but the the but to go back to your question who would you rather be of course thomas mulcair what is this saying this is saying thomas mulcair is in a position where he needs to be attacked justin trudeau has just caused another unforced error another unforced error now eve adams for some reason draws an inordinate amount of media attention i don&#39;t get it um i think she&#39;s just another backbencher but she crossed the floor uh trudeau was all excited and did a press conference with her that&#39;s going to cost them and uh that&#39;s why i wouldn&#39;t want to be justin trudeau in that situation this week so</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">so you both believe it furthers the narrative on his His judgment, or his lack of judgment when it comes to his political stripes, but also his candidacy. No, I&#39;m</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m not going to go that far. I&#39;m not going to say it&#39;s clouded his judgment, or it&#39;s proven that his judgment&#39;s faulty. I&#39;m going to say that he&#39;s had a week where he&#39;s off-message. The only message that&#39;s being heard is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the problem is you&#39;re seeing out there people saying things like, Like, oh, the same people who tried to get Eve Adams the nomination are running Trudeau&#39;s campaign. Good luck. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And it is recalling the fact that Eve Adams was a conservative who was pretty aggressive against the liberals right before she flipped and was embraced</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So it does bring back that whole story of how did we get here in the first place. As people start to look at it and they say, like, wait a minute, why did we have a nomination for the liberals between Eve Adams and another candidate? date and that&#39;s that&#39;s a problem for trudeau because that was that was a pretty head</span>

            <span class="text">it&#39;s just a bad it&#39;s just a bad week instead of what a good week and and frankly i think that trudeau is nearing the place where he has to have uh the opportunity to string together some good weeks that&#39;s you know mulcair this</span>

            <span class="text">this isn&#39;t a bad thing the the attack from the conservatives this This particular attack has been levied before. It didn&#39;t get much media attention for whatever reason. I think it&#39;s a big deal. I&#39;m actually on the conservative side on this one. They should be paying this money back. This is a lot of money. It was used for partisan purposes. That&#39;s not allowed. They should be paying the money back. And that&#39;s the ruling that they have to follow.</span>
