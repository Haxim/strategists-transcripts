          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter use The Strategists' upcoming live show in Calgary on April 10th as a launching off point to talk about events. How do you decide what to charge? What do you do when all of a sudden you have a venue, but the reason for the event has disappeared? And is a "host bar" really necessary? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>
