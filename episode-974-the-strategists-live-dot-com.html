            <span class="text">While you open up your email, strategistlive.com. Do not go to the strategistlive.com. I mean, this is an incredible value. It is podcasting on stage. This is not like Ira Glass showing up and saying, hey, this is America, and then playing radio documentaries. Oh, no. You get to see how the sausage is made. Okay? Think of it like a Zoom call, but in real life. We&#39;re just going to be there. We&#39;re going to do the same show we do. We&#39;re more than likely going to ignore you, okay? We might have a Q&amp;A at the end where I get to ask Stephen and Corey some questions, right? So we might do some of that, okay?</span>

The Strategist Live, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve mentioned this before, was taken, but strategistlive.com, not taken, now ours, okay? So this is how it worked. It was initially nobody&#39;s, then it became ours, it was taken, and now it&#39;s for you. It is for you to use strategistlive.com to get tickets. Corey, I mean, I know that this is a lot of information. It&#39;s a lot of fresh information. And delivered so quickly, yeah.</span>

            <span class="text">one might argue it&#39;s limited upon limited. It&#39;s compounding the limitation. Limited squares. There are so many limitations, but one limitation in addition to the limited time that we have, the limited number of tickets is that we were limited by the choice of website url that we have now what is the website url it is the website you go to and one of them wasn&#39;t available the one we wanted the strategist live.com it makes natural sense unfortunately taken so what we have chosen is strategist live.com that&#39;s where you need to go for your tickets limited website limited time limited number of seats carter it</span>

So that information will also be coming out if you want to do that. But it has to be paid to me, Stephen Carter, because we don&#39;t have a strategist bank account, which was also a little bit of a problem when we were trying to switch it over from my vow renewal to this podcast live thing.

There are so many limitations, but one limitation in addition to the limited time that we have, the limited number of tickets, is that we were limited by the choice of website URL that we have now. What is a website URL? It is the website you go to. And one of them wasn&#39;t available, but what we wanted, thestrategistlive.com. It makes natural sense. Unfortunately, take it. So what we have chosen is strategistlive.com. That&#39;s where you need to go for your tickets. it&#39;s limited website limited time limited number of seats carter it</span>

So that information will also be coming out if you want to do that. But it has to be paid to me, Stephen Carter, because we don&#39;t have a strategist bank account, which was also a little bit of a problem when we were trying to switch it over from my vow renewal to this podcast live thing.

If you pay fifteen hundred dollars to me, Stephen Carter, we will put your seats on stage and we will make fun of you for the entire show. So that information will also be coming out if you want to do that. But it has to be paid to me, Stephen Carter, because we don&#39;t have a strategist bank account, which was also a little bit of a problem when we were trying to switch it over from my vow renewal to this podcast live thing.
