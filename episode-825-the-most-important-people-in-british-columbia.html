            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">This is true. This is true. OK, let&#39;s move it on to our first segment, a little west and a little east. Guys, I want to talk about not just the B.C. election in B.C., but I also want to talk about the election to the east of us in Saskatchewan. And I want to talk about both of them because there&#39;s some similarities, some interesting similarities. But let&#39;s start here with B.C. and let&#39;s start with debate night, Hogan, because I know all three of us watched it. But I know you are very keen to give us a summary of your thoughts first. And I know Carter said, listen, I want to react because I&#39;ve got so much information about this debate that I actually want to go second and I want to react to what Hogan says. So, Hogan, you know, John Horgan is 18 points up heading into this debate. Andrew Wilkinson, who&#39;s a leader of the B.C. liberals, had to make a big play to try to gain some ground and perhaps gain some name recognition and relevancy. Let&#39;s start here. Did he do it tonight?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I learned a lot about BC watching this election or this debate. I learned everything in BC costs $6 billion. Spending on COVID was $6 billion. Subsidies for fossil fuel are $6 billion. PST reduction would create a $6 billion hole in revenue. That&#39;s really neat. It&#39;s neat how everything is $6 billion in BC. I also learned that Wilkinson is not a man I want want to be in a room with for 90 minutes um this is not necessarily any shot against the man personally but uh his presence at the debate i found uh drifted between uh grading and you know another word for grading there was no drift he had monotony in his voice the entire way through and um and for all of those reasons i think horgan did exactly what he needed to do now obviously well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well maybe not obviously but horgan had the one gaffe that everybody is talking about about right now where he said i don&#39;t see color which we&#39;ve already kind of hinted at um which was very woke to say in the 80s when there were united color of benedict ads that showed people in like exaggerated garb walking around as as their idea of multiculturalism but not something you want to be saying in 2020 for sure um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know and i and i think that what can i say the uh first no was that was my first exposure to her and it was really good she did really well but she did really well graded on a curve Horgan was the clear winner in absolute terms for me Carter</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Carter I know as someone who also you know yourself in this case who also watched the debate that you&#39;ve got many thoughts yourself um I know you&#39;ve got you you&#39;ve watched the debate you studied it um but maybe I&#39;ll zoom out of the debate for a second just to kind of you know throw you a curveball right because that&#39;s what I do Carter um Andrew Wilkinson walked into this with with very little name recognition, 18 to 20 points down depending on which polls you believe, some version of a sexist roast scandal, which you can perhaps explain to the audience if they are not already familiar with it. We&#39;ve talked on our other podcast about political Hail Marys. Tonight was the only televised leaders debate for him. We didn&#39;t see any version of a Hail Mary. Was that a mistake in your mind?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

And so watching him in a debate, watching him interact with regular human beings, even the fact that he didn&#39;t step in on that sexist comment that was made by, I think it was Jane Thornthwaite, but he</span>

But just because you&#39;ve got a lot of qualifications doesn&#39;t mean you can step onto that debate stage tonight and enthrall people. You know, him talking about the pregnancy that, you know, he was able to deliver a baby and therefore he has more understanding of of how uh minorities are experiencing the world you</span>

You always love to be second place, come from behind, less pressure, more latitude, more flexibility.

I personally liked Andrew Wilkinson&#39;s stance. I thought it was a time for government and opposition to come together for the people of their province. But then Horgan goes ahead and takes advantage of that opportunity and is now trying to turn his minority government into a majority government. And I think he&#39;s well positioned to do so.

You know, often we see, you know, large leads leading to a lot of supporters potentially staying at home, or at least that second concentric circle, which is supportive, registers themselves on the public opinion polls, but decides whatever 18 point lead, my vote doesn&#39;t matter.

There&#39;s been an amazing pickup on the number of people who&#39;ve asked for mail-in ballots. I think it was 20,000 in the last election. It&#39;s 500,000 in this election. What about the people who didn&#39;t request a mail-in ballot, right? What about those people? Will they actually go to the polls? What if we see an uptick in the number of COVID cases as a result of Thanksgiving weekend? Everybody went home to their own Trump-like super spreader event, and then they go back out to their workplaces, and all of a sudden, everything&#39;s starting to pick up a little bit, and there&#39;s more COVID, and there&#39;s more fear, and now people don&#39;t go out to vote. I think that that&#39;s reasonable. I also think that it is reasonable that the people who are selecting or asking for mail-in ballots are not necessarily 100% representative. I think that the most likely case is those are the most committed voters, right?</span>

You&#39;ve got an opponent, in this case, the NDP, who happens to be a doctor, Dr. Ryan Miley. And you&#39;ve also got the political dynamic here in Saskatchewan that BC shares, which is the official, quote unquote, federal version of the conservatives and the liberals in each province have formed not a net new party, what in Saskatchewan they have, the Saskatchewan Party, kind of housing and encasing both Fed libs and Fed conservatives in one party.

And they will tell me from the perspective of the party or the individual I mentioned, whether it was fine, whether it was fabulous, or whether it was totally fucked from a strategic angle. And no better way to explain it other than to just get right into it. And Stephen, I&#39;m going to start with you. Jason Kenney today said he&#39;s firing 11,000 AHS workers as part of a reduction, no frontline workers, including nurses or doctors, but custodial staff, janitorial staff, et cetera, as part of AHS will be let go in the midst of this pandemic. So if you&#39;re Jason Kenney, is this fine, fabulous or fucked?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think it&#39;s fucked. I mean, first of all, this idea that custodians aren&#39;t in some fashion frontline services, that receptionists aren&#39;t frontline services just because the work isn&#39;t done by a doctor or a nurse doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not something that is front facing. Have you ever been to a hospital? Do you want to see a a dirty hospital does anybody want to walk down the hall when the when when the hospital hasn&#39;t been cleaned now they say they&#39;re going to outsource it which is fine whatever gonna hand it off to a private company all that basically means is that you&#39;re going to try and get around union union deals and pay less money um that&#39;s not great for our economy right now you&#39;re going to take let&#39;s say 20 of of someone&#39;s earnings off the table these people aren&#39;t making a lot lot of money in the beginning, and now they&#39;re going to have less money.

Let me stick to something a little bit more calming. I&#39;m sticking with you. But I&#39;ve learned my mistake from last time, which is I&#39;m not going to give you another rant or a runway for a rant. At least I hope not. But let&#39;s go to something more calming and something more green. The Green Party. Let&#39;s talk about Annamie Paul. And there&#39;s two things I want to talk about. This is a double-barrel question, and I know you can handle it. Two things that she has done strategically. The first one is that she has asked the federal NDP to not run a candidate in the by-election she&#39;s now running in in Toronto Centre. That&#39;s been part one. And part two is that she&#39;s asked that because of the surging COVID rates, especially in Toronto Centre, that the by-election be delayed. So from her perspective, two answers, two questions, fine, fabulous or fuck. So from her perspective, the Green Party perspective, Carter, over to you on both of those questions. What do you think?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">You can ask the NDP not to run against you, but there is absolutely no precedent for the leader. You know, like if this was a green seat, you could almost make the case that if Anna May Paul was stepping forward to win the seat of an MP who stepped down. But that precedent hasn&#39;t been recognized forever, and it certainly does not exist for the fifth place party in the House. So you can ask for it, but don&#39;t get all tied up in a knot when it isn&#39;t granted to you by the other parties. In terms of delaying the by-election, there is no delay of the by-election that&#39;s going to occur. I mean, yes, the pandemic is certainly ramping up in Toronto more so than it is in British Columbia. But B.C., Saskatchewan, New Brunswick have held elections. A by-election, it&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, same question to you, the double barrel question here. The first one around, you know, trying to get the NDP to not run a candidate in the Toronto Centre by-election and secondly, trying to delay it on both of those strategic items. If you&#39;re the Greens, find fabulous or fact.</span>

There is no reason why the NDP would not run a candidate here, but it makes it uncomfortable for them, right? When you talk about doing politics differently, when you talk about the</span>

I think that&#39;s a pretty unobjectionable statement. And so it makes things awkward for them. And when you make things awkward for your political opponent, that&#39;s good. So I don&#39;t have a problem. And in fact, I think it&#39;s a really interesting way to kind of throw a wrench into the NDP campaign, because they&#39;re going to be dealing with</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Why are you even running? You were asked not to run. Wouldn&#39;t we benefit from having Annamie in the House of Commons? I mean, actually, if Toronto Centre thought that, they could have elected her when she ran in 2019 there, and they didn&#39;t. But, you know, it makes things uncomfortable for the NDP. On the second one about the delay of the election, I think that I&#39;m a little more measured, and I go like a fine slash fine fucked. I just don&#39;t think, generally speaking, it&#39;s a good idea to cast dispersions on campaigns, especially at this moment we&#39;re in right now, right? right? It&#39;s got to be safe. There&#39;s no question about that. You know, health standards have to be adhered to. But the idea that you would do anything that would make an election seem less legitimate if it proceeded at this moment, does not sit well with me philosophically. Strategically, again, a lot of the same logic applies. But I just I that is not a bridge I would have crossed. That&#39;s for sure.</span>

            <span class="text">Don&#39;t make it a bigger issue for more Americans, but just Just find an answer that sticks, for Christ&#39;s sake. Like this bleeding over a week has just been absolutely absurd. You know, I think Joe Biden in many ways was, I don&#39;t like the answer of they&#39;re the ones packing the court. You know, takes one to know one, two wrongs make a right. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s particularly compelling. I would have stuck more closely to what Biden&#39;s original answer was and expanded on it. It&#39;s like, are you going to pack the court? Sure.

Now, the problem is, you&#39;re gonna have to deal with it right before the election then. But I just I don&#39;t like what the Democrats have done on this and how they&#39;re twisting on this particular issue. It was Pence&#39;s strongest part of the vice presidential debate because he was right. Harris wasn&#39;t answering and she was clearly being evasive on the topic, which actually makes it look shadier than if they just came out and said, yeah, yeah, they do this. We&#39;re just going to neutralize that choice by putting in a choice of our own and increasing the size of the court. The</span>
