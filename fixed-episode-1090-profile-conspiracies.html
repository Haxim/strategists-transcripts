            <div class="said">Yeah, like, there&#39;s a school of thought on that regard that says, they&#39;re a distraction, they don&#39;t help. There&#39;s another school of thought that says they humanize, they have an ability to effectively make a political staffer a known quantity. And once they&#39;re a known quantity, they actually make them a trading chip, which is not necessarily bad for an office. So I think there&#39;s a school of thought there we can discuss. As it relates to the politician, it depends who&#39;s the politician, what&#39;s the outlet, what&#39;s the relationship with the reporter. I&#39;d almost turn this back to you, Annalise, with your expertise in media relations, right? But there are some key questions that you you have to ask around what&#39;s their objective, what&#39;s their story, what&#39;s your story, is it worth it if their story gets told over your story, or can you find other outlets for it? And so when you mostly see political profiles these days of politicians, you have a good sense of who the writer is, what their objective is, they&#39;re pretty upfront with it. And frankly, one of the rules that you&#39;d probably want to have in place is understand who, understand how long, understand when and then think about um when as in when the publication date is and then when you talk about the actual interview itself my lesson has always been shorter rather than longer right it&#39;s key messages over and over this goes back to the heart of media training for for anyone which is is the longer you speak the more uh raw material you give them to mold into a piece that uh allows to to shape it in their own direction of course barring stephen carter&#39;s carter jump</div>

            <div class="said">to understand them, they have two components. One Carter&#39;s mentioned, they&#39;re actually about writing a mythology about you rather than the actual truth, because inevitably it will be mythology. Not to say reporters trying to produce a narrative, but there&#39;s a narrative they&#39;re trying to box this into. For the Rob Anderson one, it&#39;s a comeback story, right? Regardless of what you think of his politics, it&#39;s a pretty interesting comeback story of someone who thought he was DOA out of politics in the fringes of a political movement, finds that political movement shifts towards his ideological favoring, finds himself back into quote unquote power. That comeback story is really interesting. And so yes, we have the tear up and the build down, but we also have a how do they do it, you know, inside the campaign retrospective of how they did its story, which then focuses on the person. I know, Carter, you&#39;ve been subject to a few of those in that But I would also say that often the</div>

            <div class="said">are not an asset, if you are not a known quantity, it is really hard to take you down, right? So to Carter&#39;s point, there&#39;s probably a part of Rob Anderson who&#39;s like, okay, this is not terrible because, you know, who knows when I&#39;ll need my next gig. And this is a pretty decent profile written me in the paper of record in Canada&#39;s publication. This actually spreads my wings across the country in a meaningful way, gets my name known. Not bad for a next gig somewhere, right? Not bad for a brand building presence. The downside is we now know the name Rob Anderson. And as soon as we know that name, if something happens in Daniel Smith&#39;s office, Rob</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">Rob Anderson is someone we now know, the general public. I&#39;m not saying this is going to be a blast zone that thousands and thousands of people know, but it&#39;s similar to what happened with SNC-Lavalin and Jerry Butts. Known quantity, he becomes a trading chip, right? Known quantity becomes someone that can be the fall guy. And I&#39;d say if we&#39;re getting into Alberta politics for a second, zooming back in, if there&#39;s going to be a fall guy in Daniel Smith&#39;s office, you&#39;re seeing it in Rob Anderson. It is going to be this person. And so the buildup, I&#39;d say, is very much a necessary precursor to the takedown because it&#39;s about trying to inform people on who these folks are. And I look at Carter&#39;s national profile, which if you have not seen, is a beautiful profile on Carter. Like, it&#39;s one of the first things that I saw that that had Carter and I get in touch on back in 2011, 2012, prior to my days working with Stephen and Corey together. But I would say, Carter, in your case, though, those were a precursor to then allow for that sprawl piece many, many years later, because you became a known quantity in this space. Well,</div>

I remember when I covered City Hall, doing a big profile of like Nenshi versus Bill Smith, and people knew Nenshi, right? We knew his story. We knew about those library books from Forest Lawn. We knew all those pieces of his story that he told again and again and again. And so as a journalist being like, hey, who are some new people I can talk to or what&#39;s the side of him that the public doesn&#39;t know about is extremely hard when it&#39;s been out there for years and it is fitting in that box and that sort of thing. So do either of you have thoughts on the strategy? And I think we thought to a certain degree this time too, Zane, with Rachel Notley as well, right? like she&#39;s had a lot of profile pieces and in the lead up to this election there was you know here&#39;s a new voice who&#39;s her</div>

            <div class="said">you are always looking to refresh but keeping your brand largely consistent unless you don&#39;t want to keep your brand largely consistent. So let&#39;s talk about the refresh and then let&#39;s talk about the reinvention, right? Because this does lead into last time when we talked about the pure polyeth brands. When you&#39;re talking about the refresh, you&#39;re looking for added pieces that are within that same lane that justify that brand. They could be things that happened recently. They could be things that are personal. They could be things that kind of show a particular hobby, a particular sort of partner that might finally be comfortable to come in view in the camera, proverbially and perhaps even literally. So when you&#39;re expanding, it&#39;s like a refresh where you&#39;re saying, this is a known quantity that you know. Here&#39;s the added elements that continue to justify their values, their principle, their lived experience in a way that you know them. Does that generally work? No, but it adds a bit more meat on the bone. It kind of gives you that warm, touchy-feely sort of like, okay, I know this person. They continue to be that person. They haven&#39;t erred from their ways. And that reminder alone, we often forget is quite important, right? Like the reminder of Oh, yeah, that&#39;s why I liked Rachel Notley is actually kind of important in a campaign, right? Because there are folks that, you know, through the day to day lives, they don&#39;t live our lives, they live their lives, they don&#39;t live the lives of continually trying to push certain advocacy principles or marketing messages, they are kind of ebbed and flowed. So for many of them, forgetting, let&#39;s use Rachel as an example, that she was premier, forgetting that there was a moment and a bit of a wave around her, forgetting that there was a bit of a halo effect around her. You&#39;re trying to re-engineer, recreate those sort of emotional moments. On the rebrand basis, you&#39;re almost going for broke in certain cases, right? The rebrand is very</div>

            <div class="said">very much a last-ditch strategy if you know your existing strategy is not working. And the rebrand, and let me be clear because I was not clear last episode, at least in Carter&#39;s eyes, is when you are a known quantity, you&#39;re a known public quantity, they know you and what they have known about you for months, years, if not longer, is what you fundamentally have to change. And when you&#39;re at that situation in politics, it&#39;s a very different game than if you&#39;re doing the small tweaks, the reinforcements, the reminders, which are very much the former or that first category.</div>

You know, I&#39;ve been lucky to work with a number of underdogs, right? Right. And underdogs. Yeah.

            <div class="said">I don&#39;t know. Okay, so here&#39;s the thing. There&#39;s two ways to look at that shelf life question, and it&#39;s a good one posed by Carter, because one way to look at it is that it is as ephemeral as the day-to-day news, right? That this was a profile done last week, it&#39;ll be forgotten by the week after. But the question is, what is that profile for? Is it for informing the public through a specific discrete time period, as Carter might be suggesting? Or is it for archival purposes? And I&#39;d argue that these profiles, if you buy the principle that they are to make Rob Anderson, in this case, an asset, just like it was for Jerry Butts, or David Axelrod, or a Jon Favreau, or a Karl Rove back in the day, when they had profiles by the New York Times, or the Guardian, or the Washington Post or the Globe and Mail or Torstar, that these were not necessarily about consuming them in that moment, that these were search results. These were part of the package that kind of like said, who the, I just met with a Rob Anderson, who the fuck is this guy? That sort of thing. Or when he pops up again, there&#39;s now something to pin it down. And I think it&#39;s going to be consumed in that way. What I agree with Carter on is that gen pop, not really. Political circles, yes, important and across the country. So this is why I&#39;m kind of split on this, right? In one way, I hate it because it&#39;s like, dude, this is such a distraction from the day to day. In another way, this is now going to be Rob Anderson&#39;s number one Google result, more than likely, one would imagine, right?</div>

We&#39;ve seen this movie. It&#39;s a comeback story. So you can park the politics. It&#39;s a really interesting comeback story. So I wish there was a little bit more meat on the bone. And it&#39;s already 2000 words. So I really in no position to criticize it at all. But I would want to make that very clear, right? This is when we talk about build up and tear down, we talk about the ability to it&#39;s probably going to be someone else, if not everybody, if he has a flaming sort of exit out of politics again. The other thing I will say, I think it&#39;s really important for us to understand that these sort of pieces, as much as like I, with my strategist hat, I&#39;m like kind of split and hoping that you guys would persuade me from a pure democracy perspective, I love them. I actually love them because we&#39;ve talked on this show many times about even Carter, if this is a mythology, and even if he&#39;s getting too much And even if and even if to talk about the gatekeepers, to talk about the people behind the scene, I think is so fucking important because this guy right here and that premier&#39;s office will make the majority of the decisions for this premier will allow certain things to happen, will disallow other things to happen. And I think as the spotlight and sunlight on democracy, from that perspective, more of this shit, like way more of this shit. So like, kudos to Kelly on her effort here. I just wish there&#39;s more of it. From a strategist perspective is where I&#39;m kind of conflicted around the upside downside, reading it from the pure political map. Well,</div>

            <div class="said">this this era that carter kind of i&#39;d say carter in some ways you represent of the political staff or the chief of staff with whether you had latitude or not is is a question to decide right uh but you you ultimately you ultimately spoke your mind yeah right while in the position and that was like a net new well last 30 years there There was sparse examples, you pointed out some of them, but relatively net new sort of phenomenon, right? Where you&#39;d hire someone to kind of be the shadow, you know, this very almost sort of tradition from the, you know, we want the White House chief of staff and they don&#39;t say shit because they show their muscle internally. They never flex it externally. They&#39;ve got thousands of people on the payroll to do that shit as their day-to-day craft. So why are they doing it? But I&#39;d say Carter and to a certain extent, someone like Jerry Butts, who while still still being in the principal secretary role in the PMO was firing off missives on a daily basis, Twitter, social media, sometimes even mainstream media, not to say that they&#39;d sit on panels while you were chief of staff and talk shit to people. But it was also, to be totally clear, goes back to an earlier point. There&#39;s a personal brand building element to this. All these fucking jobs have expiry dates. They could be long expiry dates, which is like a year or two, or they can It could be shorter expiry dates, which is in the months, which, by the way, is not that uncommon for many of these jobs. 10, 12 months, you&#39;re kind of out of there. And so if you have the light on you, right, if you have the spotlight on you, you&#39;re thinking about tomorrow. And in many cases, you&#39;re quite literally thinking about tomorrow in terms of your prospects, because as much as it is, hey, and you buy into all that sort of broader West Wingology of I could do more in a day in these jobs than I can in a lifetime, you&#39;re also looking out for yourself to say, will this profile help my potential pundit gig? Will this get me into a GR firm? Will I be able to maybe leverage this onto a board seat where they can pay me 50, 60 grand a year because I know it&#39;s not going to be a soft landing because I&#39;m going to be the fall guy? And so for many people, if and when this profile is written while they&#39;re in office, they also know that there&#39;s a second profile to our earlier conversation that is going to be written. They actually know they&#39;re going to be the fall guy. I bet Rob Anderson knows right now Now, if shit gets rough for Danielle Smith that it&#39;s about her survivability versus a leadership race, and let&#39;s just throw out an arbitrary number, 12, 16, 18, 24 months, Rob Anderson&#39;s the first trading ship she has, and he probably already knows that. So I think this, while Carter might say he was probably kicking and screaming wanting to do it, in some ways it&#39;s probably an asset to him. The headline is nice, right? The pictures are good. This is helpful. All these simple things are extremely helpful to a Rob Anderson, regardless of of the current status that enroll that he holds yeah</div>

And I&#39;m not saying a formal attachment, but I&#39;m saying a tactical attachment. I mean, this is a part and parcel strategy. Those petition pages you listed are part and parcel of what the rebel would do on a daily basis. Something pops up, you know it&#39;s going to motivate the base, and you&#39;re going to get a few more people that haven&#39;t signed up to data harvest and get on board. And rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. He&#39;s built an operation tactically inside his office. He built an operation during the leadership. So, no, this number does not surprise me. There&#39;s many things to talk about around the harvesting of data, the strategies used for it, things like list quality, etc. But no, the top line number to answer your question does not surprise me.

These are not petitions that Pierre Pauliev or the conservative party, these are petitions that they&#39;re trying to like, these aren&#39;t government petitions we&#39;re talking about. These are political data harvesting activities where I have your email and I will be in touch with you to elevate your level of engagement. You signed a petition, sign another fucking petition. You sign another fucking petition, hey, ever want to come to my rally? Want to volunteer a couple hours? Want to bring friends and family? There&#39;s a natural cycle of elevating people&#39;s behavior vis-a-vis these petitions, which is at the heart of them, to be totally clear, and I know most people listening will probably already appreciate that.

They haven&#39;t really participated. So what&#39;s really interesting if you&#39;re a peer polyev and what I&#39;d love a deeper dive on by the media organizations and some way to find out is list quality, right? How many of these people are actually going to show up to vote and how this number is impressive top line. But because many of these people have never really taken that action before, there&#39;s two ways of thinking about it. Net new voter, we have them captured for the first time. Exciting. Or net</div>

            <div class="said">net new voter, they&#39;ve never actually done this physical thing before. Are they going to actually follow through on it? And so you have a real question on what the quality of this list is. So as much as the top line number, 200 grand is really interesting. And he&#39;s going to continue that and it&#39;s going to become 500 and 700. And the campaign is going to be here soon enough. And we&#39;re going to hear new stories like, and the conservatives have signed up 750,000 new people on the list. I want everyone listening to ask a question around list quality. How good is that list? Because what we know about advocacy and petition lists, Carter, you and I know this extremely well. It&#39;s this basic 80-20 rule. 20% of people will do 80% of the activity. The other 80% will probably not show up for you, whether that&#39;s more of their time signing another petition, more of their time on the ground, or actually what matters, you&#39;re pulling through and marking an X on a ballot. So this will all be impressive. This will all look like momentum. But we have to ask ourselves a question that&#39;s much deeper around the quality of the list.

Sticky is one thing, and then it&#39;s like, what can they do, right?

If you give me a couple of bucks to fundraise, excellent. If you show up offline to commit some time, when you keep triaging and triaging and and triaging, layering, and layering, and layering. When you take that group of folks that only does the second plus activity, it&#39;s a very, very small number. It might be in the tens of thousands, but it&#39;s not 200,000. And so when we talk about list quality, that&#39;s what we mean. Now, we would love to understand how deep that list quality is. For example, is he getting 30, 40, 50%? Half his list doing two plus actions? What are those actions? That&#39;s the way a campaign decides if what they have internally, that&#39;s the way Pierre Polyev&#39;s team is looking at these. They&#39;re probably going to put these numbers out two, three, four, 500 as they grow as top line fodder because it&#39;s nice chum. It&#39;s easy to digest. It&#39;s scary because then we&#39;ll have stories about liberal sort of numbers and they won&#39;t be as impressive. But what really matters is who&#39;s going to do the second, third, fourth order activities that ultimately result in them bringing more people like them to the polls and voting. This only activates, only works, only is useful in terms of time, investment, creative messaging, if that final action happens.</div>

And that might be an incredibly, incredibly profitable list. Um, so some of the, and some of the investigation that can be done, the United United States has far more disclosure about these things. Take a look at the disclosure. If you were to take a look at the donors, the small value donors from the CPC, compare them to the list size that Pierre Polyev is talking, you know, is bragging of, and then compare it against metrics from the United States, we&#39;d be able to see very strongly what is the actual engagement rate of his list.

But what would you hazard to guess the gender and age skew is of this 200,000?</div>

            <div class="said">I&#39;ll jump on this. I would be willing to bet it is way more 50-50 than any of us would think. On gender. Yeah, I think that there is this kind of misconception that there aren&#39;t a whole bunch of conservative women. There are a ton of conservative women, and they are finding their voice in a way that we haven&#39;t necessarily seen before. So these lists and the way that these lists are developed, they can be very much targeted towards a female audience. and it kind of you know i&#39;m always kind of surprised and i don&#39;t mean to be kind of sexist about it but i always think that women are smarter than that and and then i&#39;m surprised and shocked to find out that they&#39;re not um so you know this is this is part of the the joy of building these lists is that gender and age they tend towards older because younger people very very much will not give up their email addresses they will not give up their contact information information older people think that joining a list is a good thing getting an email is a good thing younger</div>

            <div class="said">that&#39;s all women that overlay with what many people would think is a progressive sort of like let&#39;s go women 35 to 55 which across the country generally lean more progressive, that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s not millions of women that are conservative in that cohort. We can get you those people. It&#39;ll cost you $20, $30, $40 a conversion, but we can build you that list. So the question you ask, I don&#39;t mean to kind of undercut the question. I think it&#39;s a really fascinating question because the root of it was, how did they build their list? Did they say women are going to be the deciding factor in the next election? So we want to strategically build a list of women of of a certain age and certain geographies, because if they did so, I&#39;m actually a little bit more impressed with that top line number. My question still comes back to list quality, but I&#39;m a bit more impressed because it&#39;s like, okay, interesting. They&#39;re actually looking after the composite swing voter in terms of who they&#39;ve incubated in that list versus be all, you know, come on in. It&#39;s an open season to come on in conspiracy theorists, young people, old people, whatever. I&#39;m less impressed because those folks are not going to decide the election. List quality will suffer for even more, especially when we add in that first time voter question. So the question I&#39;m back to anyone that I&#39;d ask who&#39;s on that list is how much money did they spend to get it and who do they want? Because if they were strategic, that I&#39;m way more impressed with than if they just said, where is this petition best going to work? Let&#39;s just organically spread it out wherever whoever comes in, comes in. We&#39;re going to do whatever we can with them and try to maximize it versus a clear, concise, and I&#39;d be very clear, expensive strategy to get the swing voter in in certain areas that are going to push through in terms of the next federal election.</div>

And if you structure it in such a way to say you&#39;re the first 1,000 and the whole goal is to get the next 1,000 of you, could you do it? I bet we could. I bet we could double the discord if we wanted to. And that&#39;s not a compliment to us. It&#39;s just at a certain point, it&#39;s human behavior, organizational psychology principles that are kicking to play, right? The first 1,000, they want to interact with more people like them. So of course, to have an incentive to grow the community and any good political campaign to kind of tie a bow on this a bit actually taps into that, which is to say, can we get our first 50 volunteers? And can those first 50 volunteers really fucking love to be there, right? And to get to the first 50, we&#39;re going to have to have churn of 250 people who put up their hand, but 50 will stay. And out of the 50, 15 of them will really like each other. And out of the 15, another 10 will bring someone else to join them. And that&#39;s how you start building that little group of community over and over. At the end of any political campaign, I give a speech, if I get a chance to run a campaign, and I say, we have an objective tomorrow, election day, but one of the objectives has already been fulfilled. For you to have a platform to meet people like you, look around who&#39;s here. You&#39;ve all become friends over the course of the last three months, six months, nine months, year, two years, depending on this experience. You know, and that&#39;s something that regardless of what happens tomorrow, no one can take away from you. And you see that, Carter, we&#39;ve been part of that. We&#39;ve</div>

So it&#39;s really fascinating that we discuss a massive list number of 200,000, which will balloon up to 500,000, and what it actually takes to build a community. Because if you ask me, I would take 1,500 hyper-engaged people over 200,000 people on a list if the list quality is ultimately the differentiator. And when I say list quality for the last 25 minutes, that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m talking about. It&#39;s what you can form through a sense of community, through a sense of purpose, through a sense of spinning up more people like you.</div>

It was really interesting. I&#39;ll throw it in the Discord if people are interested in that one. But that one was really fascinating because it actually used another sort of brand of profile. It wasn&#39;t the comeback. It wasn&#39;t the the how do they do it? This was mid cycle. It was like the relationship between the young 20 something and this like cool, hip black senator. And I thought that was fascinating, like the trust bonds that were built between them, the like what that that relationship kind of almost symbolically meant around Obama&#39;s candidacy.

One is the Carter stream, opportunistic, whatever&#39;s next, show that I&#39;ve got my pulse on Canadians, build my list, harvest it with whatever quality. The second stream is, let&#39;s get the names that will actually decide the next election. Let&#39;s figure out which demos, which places, which people will actually decide the next election, and I&#39;m going after them. Is it expensive? Yes. Do I have money? I sure do. Let&#39;s spend it on that. Okay.</div>
