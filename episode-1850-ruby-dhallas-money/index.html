        <p>The Liberal leadership is over and Prime Minister-Designate Mark Carney has two weeks to get ready for an election. What did we learn from the conclusion of the race? And what now?</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the conclusion of the Liberal leadership race and what's next for Mark Carney and Pierre Poilievre. What lessons can be learned from the leadership announcement event? Should Carney immediately call an election? Has Pierre Poilievre found his line of attack? And should Zain be concerned about how many people want to host The Strategists? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

I want to spend most of it on the now what, because I think that&#39;s way more interesting than what happened. But there are elements of what happened on Sunday, and I&#39;m talking about the Kearney any landslide victory in the liberal leadership that I think are worthy of a strategist podcast discussion. And then I want to get into the now what. What does he need to do? Some of the moves he&#39;s already made, some of the things he&#39;s already said. How do they land for you guys? But Corey, let&#39;s start with what we saw. And I&#39;ll get to the results in a second.</div>

          <div class="said">Maybe I can start with this. Tell me about the production that you saw. What did you make of the liberal production that they put together as part of this leadership result? It was carried Carried by all the major networks, it was streaming online. They had intros for both Carney and Trudeau by their respective daughters. They had each of the candidates having a on-the-floor mic moment that they had. And, of course, they had a keynote, one would call it, or plenary, by Jean-Croix Chen, which probably ran 25 minutes more than anyone anticipated, except Jean-Croix Chen. So just to summarize for folks, that was, maybe not in that order, certainly not in that order, That was the liberal production. Corey, what did you make of it? And then Carter, what did you make of it? And then we&#39;ll get into the results and et cetera, et cetera.</div>

          <div class="said">the liberal palette is already very red heavy. It&#39;s the color of the party, obviously. I mean, it was just wrapped in Canadiana. You can absolutely see what they were going for. But it didn&#39;t entirely hit for me. I feel like they could have spent a little bit more of Ruby Dalla&#39;s money on the production values. That probably would have worked a little bit better for me. There were some things that felt a little bit janky, but let&#39;s be frank.</div>

          <div class="said">Corey, do we just feel that way? I said because of the political timeline as being one of those things, the Trump-generated timeline that is making a day a week feel like a week. But was it also, did two months feel like enough because the result was just known? If it was more competitive, and if it was more competitive on the money raised, on the membership sort of splits, on other metrics, on debates, on internal polling, et cetera, would we have felt, you know what, I wish Christopher Freeland had another three months of this because she could have really got a groove because all the other metrics were aligned for her, for example. So I just want to stress test this a bit before we jump into why we love the two-month or six-week version of a leadership race versus not, just because of the uniqueness of this one.</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah. Look, I think you could still optimize further from what the liberals have got i think you could have had some debates earlier i know that wouldn&#39;t be popular with the campaigns because they&#39;re all out hustling for memberships but i think you could do that i think you could have forums across the country there are ways that you could do more but i think the timeline was great and as we are talking this out one of the things that occurs to me is one of the reasons leadership contests were so long is because we built the leadership process process for delegated conventions. And we just slowly swapped out pieces as we got to one member one vote, online voting, but we didn&#39;t change the fucking timelines. And so necessity being the mother of invention, when the liberals found they didn&#39;t have the time, they realized they didn&#39;t need the time and that the process actually runs just fine in a one member one vote, online voting world with two months. All of the rest of that was there for processes we don&#39;t use anymore. It was to allow people time to have local meetings. It was to allow people time, you</div>

          <div class="said">you know, delegates who got elected to then plan to be somewhere else for a whole week, right? And that does take time, but it doesn&#39;t take time just to go online and watch a few debates and then to vote. Like, that just doesn&#39;t take the time. And so what we should be reminded by this is that sometimes you just got to reinvent something that you&#39;ve just been slowly tinkering on. Like, You need to go and stress test it. In some ways, it&#39;s like classic operations management stuff. You put this process down, you say what parts of it are not adding value, and you take those parts out. And the liberals took those parts out. They took out the doldrums, and it worked fine.</div>

So there&#39;s knock-on effects and there&#39;s considerations all over the board, but they&#39;re not all bad. The idea that you can get a new leader in two months, I think should be liberating for a lot of political parties. Oh,</div>

          <div class="said">Oh, yeah. Let&#39;s get into the results, Carter. You know, when I saw that there was 400,000 people registered and only 150,000 people that voted. I was a bit concerned for Mark Carney because you&#39;d think that a lot of the folks that didn&#39;t show up were kind of that soft Carney support, knowing that his campaign had taken credit for a lot of the signups, so to speak. But that was not the case, Stephen Carter. 86% of the vote, domination in every single riding across the country, he won. He won the riding of his competitors handily. He had more More votes, interestingly, I&#39;d say, and more people vote for him in Alberta than in Quebec. Of course, he won both. So it was immaterial, but interesting at the end of the day. This was a crushing. This was 86%. This was similar, actually almost identical to the race that the Alberta NDP here had with 86% for Nenshi. And the next place contestant, I believe, was at 8% or so, under 10. But it was a domination, Stephen Carter.</div>

That was clearly underestimating the guy. It is fascinating that the percents of points mirrored almost identically the Alberta NDP contest. I think it&#39;s one of those great political coincidences. But I also think it&#39;s not that much of a coincidence. Parties are looking for saviors and parties are willing to push behind saviors at this point. But there is a day after that saviorship. And I think what we&#39;ve seen with Nahid Nenshi and the the alberta ndp is it&#39;s it&#39;s not a guarantee of general election resonance or success right certainly not in the short term and all the liberals have is a short term so what i&#39;m most struck by is that</div>

But there&#39;s just this expectation that the leader gets these massive numbers, I think, these days. And that&#39;s a weird thing for me, right? Because there are going to be leaders who win, limping out with 55%. And they might just forever be toast now. Like, we just might not be able to hold on to a leader who doesn&#39;t win by such a commanding margin. That&#39;s</div>

And I look at the Ford playbook of what he did in Ontario, which go down to Washington, do the job, I&#39;m premier, like I got to do the gig. And then, you know, spend four or five days doing that. How much, and I&#39;m just giving you options to consider and comment on. But Carter, give me your sense of what the campaign strategy here in Broadstoke should look like.

And yes, the people who have that kind of power to give have that kind of power to take. And you should be a little bit cautious about what Doug Ford might do. And it&#39;s pretty easy for him in a campaign to say, oh, geez, at the end of the day, I&#39;m a conservative. And of course, I&#39;m going to vote for Pierre Polyev. Shucks, I like Mark, but I&#39;m obviously not going to vote for him. I don&#39;t see him eye to eye with him on all these business things or whatever the fuck he wants to say, right? But if you tailor your relationship knowing that that is probably the most likely outcome in week five of the election, he can&#39;t hurt you that much. You give him a job or maybe you don&#39;t formally give him a job. You say, Doug and I don&#39;t see eye to eye on everything. Our politics are very different, but we both love Canada, right?

          <div class="said">yeah, well, look, they all, Stephen Carter just described a message frame and trying to fit everything into a frame. Yes. You build those for your opponent, too, and they clearly think they have something, maybe not with the word sneaky, but the sentiment behind it. And you have to know they focus group this. You have to know that they went in there and they put a couple of material in front of people and they put a couple of arguments in front of people and said, how does this make you feel? And if I had to guess, if I had to guess what is driving the Conservatives&#39; obsession with sneaky, which to me feels like an attack that&#39;s not quite found itself yet, I think that they&#39;ve probably put a couple of comments in front of people like, did you know Mark Carney hasn&#39;t fully disclosed X? He hasn&#39;t disclosed where all of his sources of money are. What do you think of that? Oh, that makes me feel not good as a Canadian. here&#39;s a clip of him answering a question about that at his campaign launch now that was not a great clip for him in my opinion and he got a little bit defensive in ways i don&#39;t think he needed to do and uh i think it was the weakest moment of his launch it wasn&#39;t even that week of a moment but it was clearly the weakest moment of his launch similarly what do you think about the fact that mark carney chaired a company that moved a headquarters out of canada into the united states oh i don&#39;t like that very much well let me show you a clip of him answering those questions And you see him be a little bit defensive. I also think Mark Carney bled is an exaggeration. He had a paper cut for a couple of days on this particular issue, but it showed a certain weakness and an inability to answer a question or not show the best side of him, when I frankly think he could have answered that much more plainly and much quicker than he did. but that the conservatives lacking significant ammo in other ways have found some things that people don&#39;t like and they&#39;re saying well what&#39;s the what&#39;s the combination what what ties this all together and so they&#39;re trying right now to find a way that they can bundle this general feeling of like don&#39;t</div>

But the second part of this question, Corey, is any advice for the conservatives who have, to Carter&#39;s point, millions of dollars to spend and a limited time horizon to do so? What would you advise them to do? Is it doing what they&#39;re doing right now, which is throw things out in multiple tracks and then maybe, you know, as the writ approaches, maybe have a nugget of wisdom that you can go on? What would you advise them with the resources that they have that outstrip the other political parties?</div>

And I don&#39;t know. I mean, I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re doing that right now. Maybe this is what that looks like. Maybe we&#39;ll hear about it in books afterwards. It&#39;s like, yeah, we just, we ran a million fucking things and we look like a disjointed mess. But behind the scenes, we were getting data. We were getting really important data that allowed us to run this motherfucking campaign that just put the boot to this guy&#39;s throat. Maybe that&#39;s what we&#39;ll see.
