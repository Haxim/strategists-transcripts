Was it fear? And then let&#39;s get into the where did your strategist brain go on this in terms of, oh, shit, how do I clean this mess up? I want to talk about that overarching theme on this segment around, you know, what a practitioner or strategist or a comms rep, what goes through their mind, how they construct these photo ops to begin with, and then how do they plan for them to go disastrously wrong, kind of like how it did for Jason Kenney.

We should make sure that this particular gas tank doesn&#39;t have a difficult to get in or difficult to get out gas tank. It shouldn&#39;t be that hard. Now, one would think he&#39;s filled up his truck with gas before. I mean, that thing guzzles some gas. I&#39;ll tell you that. It takes some gas all the time. So theoretically, he&#39;s done this before, but something just didn&#39;t work. And, you know, I didn&#39;t feel, like I say, I didn&#39;t feel bad for him, but I did think immediately, this is definitely something they didn&#39;t rehearse, and they probably should have.</div>

And part of the reason why it&#39;s hard to have sympathy for Jason Kenney in this moment is not because, it&#39;s not a gotcha moment. It&#39;s not as though Tom Ross just happened to be at the gas station with the premier of Alberta and said, oh, Mr. Premier, Mr. Premier, sorry to interrupt you. Well, you&#39;re filling up your car, but I&#39;ve got some questions for you. And this happens and it&#39;s this fumbling moment. This was staged. It was staged as a prop. It was a gimmicky thing to say, like, look at me. I&#39;m now filling up with cheap gas. And it went horribly awry. eye and you know i think that&#39;s where it&#39;s very difficult to have sympathy it&#39;s very funny by the way watching that clip as the look of horror comes over the premier&#39;s face oh yeah as he realizes there&#39;s something is it realizes he&#39;s failing at the act of pumping gas but you know and</div>

You want them to focus on your photo op and get your message out. That is your goal. their goal is to get you on whatever the topic of the day whatever the topic of the uh the moment is and it&#39;s a little bit of a jousting back and forth between what you want and what they want and and you know it&#39;s part of the deal right part of the deal is you know you&#39;re gonna have to answer some of their questions and they know they&#39;re gonna have to count they&#39;re gonna have to cover your um you</div>

Is it sold generally, come watch the premier pump some gas? I expect not, right? Or like it&#39;s probably scaffolded in what you said, right? The tax is no longer being applied on the provincial side. The gas is cheaper. The premier is going to pump some gas. How are these things generally sold? And then to your point from a practitioner&#39;s eye, the efficacy and the effectiveness of photo ops these days, your commentary on both. Yes.</div>

We&#39;re just going to be, this is an opportunity for photography to be taken. I can think of a million in my career where it&#39;s come here and see Brian Mason put on a hockey jersey or come watch.

And so you want compelling visuals for that because that&#39;s what drags people back. And so you help them do that by providing more than just standing in front of a lectern all of the time.

So I think they&#39;re actually pretty important still. I think the idea of compelling visuals has not changed because of the internet or social media. I feel, if anything, that hook is more important, because you can&#39;t sort of guarantee eyeballs in the same way, because every individual reader is going to decide whether it&#39;s worth sharing or not.

            <div class="said">i think that cory&#39;s point about the backgrounds and stuff is really interesting because this is now a moment when And we are watching different campaigns go in different directions. There&#39;s the formalized photo op that Corey described, you know, like Flair Airlines is opening up in Edmonton. And, you know, in front of Flair Airlines stands Premier Kenny saying, this is going to be 350 new jobs for Albertans for a good five or six months. And this is... Oh, that&#39;s actually great. so so there&#39;s that standard photo op but then there&#39;s also something that&#39;s happening in the culture in the media right now and that culture and media now has people popping in front of their bathroom mirrors to take tiktoks right and some of the politics no no politician has been tremendously successful at tiktok yet i mean people will come at me it&#39;s with saying he&#39;s got 900 000 followers they&#39;re not real okay so let&#39;s just move past that but um pierre palliev is is getting closer right and um you know some of the younger politicians some of the mlas are starting to get there and we&#39;re starting to see that sometimes just walking down the street without a backdrop with just the video of yourself holding a selfie stick or whatever talking to the camera that might be some of our new but that may not be a photo op that may be a new type of media so i maybe can i may be bringing the two together where they aren&#39;t actually together you guys It&#39;s</div>

Like if you are, let&#39;s say you&#39;re the director of communications, or you&#39;re the staffer responsible for this bundle, let&#39;s use that second category, right? Because I think this one was more in that bundle category. category what are you prepping on your side are you you&#39;re obviously prepping who from the media is going to be there who you&#39;ve pitched what other sort of elements are part of your mini comms plan and i&#39;m getting closer i&#39;m inching towards the gaff and crisis management element but before we get there what are you kind of preparing for let&#39;s use the kenny example for that photo op that happened at the end of last week what sort of things would a staffer uh have have prepared for in that regard yeah</div>

And that&#39;s how the meteorizers will be set up, and we know it will be set up at this height, and this is how it&#39;s going to be. So that&#39;s generally how it goes. When you have something like this gas pump thing, it&#39;s generally somebody has a brainwave, though, and says, I know how we&#39;re going to make this interesting. We&#39;re going to create a visual by sending the premier to go pump his gas, right? right? That&#39;s not something that happens accidentally.

If it happens, it happens. Tell me from your experience, and then let&#39;s talk about best practice in that regard too.

Uh, but there are, you know, there are kind of global approaches you have to take to this because things do go wrong. I can think of simple, dumb things like gusts of wind coming up, knocking off or down all of the visuals that are behind. I can think of some of the bigger, more embarrassing ones that are more about the construction of it. When I was in government, there was this dreadful budget shoe photo op with Joe Sisi where he wore virtual shoes. So he&#39;s wearing a VR headset and he&#39;s putting on virtual shoes as the budget event. But the photo op is just a man looking lost with his arms out wearing a giant helmet, right? So, you</div>

Kenny was, you could see him die a little bit right at the beginning and he knew this was going to go viral.

Bush at a grocery store seeing like a laser scanner being just an absolute marvel about this technology as though he had not walked into one. You know, this was the 80s. And even in the 80s, they were not new, right? Maybe it was the early 90s. Dan Quayle, potato, trying to add an E. Well, the thing is, is Dan Quayle a lightweight? Is he an idiot? So that sort of reinforces him being a lightweight, just as the grocery scanner reinforces an out-of-touch elite, just as Stockwell Day showing up in a wetsuit is just the shallowest man in the world.

So there&#39;s a large percentage of the population of voters that are undecided, and they will move in and they will fall in either probably against the frontrunner or there&#39;s more of an equal opportunity to get them.

Who need to come in. Right. And so to attract new people, to build the tent, if you will. So in the mayoralty race, Jeremy Farkas was doing very, very well. Well, Jeremy Farkas, if you were following Calgary politics, Jeremy Farkas was the anti-Nenshi. And so if you didn&#39;t like Nenshi, you already knew who your guy was.

But do know that if you don&#39;t find a way to bring in the next level of like we, you know, Alison Redford was at 19 percent with two weeks to go. You know, she got 19 percent of the first ballot and she wound up winning the next week or two weeks later. Why? Well, because we engaged a whole bunch of new people.

But if you see things that are working for them, then go and say, okay, well, how did they get 300 people to this event? What were the channels that they used? What were the messages that they used? Is any of that available to us? Is it specific to who he is? Is it specific to his message? And just grab the components you can as you can. I mean, I say it all the time, and I&#39;ll say it again, good strategy comes from good analysis. And a huge part of analysis on any campaign is having your head up and looking about and seeing what the other team is doing, too.

How skeptical are you of what you&#39;re seeing from what Pierre-Paul Lefebvre is doing, at least how he&#39;s mobilizing, to your point, Carter, the hyper-engaged and perhaps creating a new cohort of hyper-engaged with this campaign right now?

And turnout does tend to be 70-80% these days, right? It&#39;s not like when we were scraping down into the low 50s in the 90s, when it just seemed like low stakes, low interest elections here. It&#39;s hard for me to imagine that in a broad based voter pool, that Poiliev is going to do particularly well. So it does make it more likely the Liberals win. It does, of course, course make the consequences of them losing more significant and so that&#39;s part of why i would be a little bit nervous i mean think about how much people joked</div>

But Pope Francis has apologized for the conduct of some members of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada&#39;s residential school system following a week of talks with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis delegations. So what do you make of that? Are you in or out on this apology from what you&#39;re sensing right now? The positives that many are saying is that it&#39;s unprecedented. The negative, many are saying, well, it does not acknowledge the systemic nature. It&#39;s kind of isolating the some members part of it. What are you kind of thinking when you process this? Top line thoughts? We&#39;ll, of course, discuss it on a future episode.</div>

But it&#39;s also appropriate to step forward and try and make things right. And I don&#39;t know that the Catholic Church and the Canadian government have necessarily necessarily been able to step forward to start to make things right yet um there seems to be a time heals all wounds type of scenario with um you know but it it really doesn&#39;t a you know generational um generational impact will be it continues to be felt and you know one need only look at the statistics uh the statistics of uh indigenous youth and care in the province of of Alberta, tell us a story that says that things aren&#39;t right.</div>

And given the fact that the numbers haven&#39;t changed in probably 20 years, it doesn&#39;t look like we&#39;re making much in the way of good progress to fix this generational problem. So I applaud the Pope for his decision to apologize. But it&#39;s one of those situations where an apology is simply not going to be enough. And we as Canadians need to step up and figure out how to fix something that, But frankly, most of us, certainly me on this side of the microphone, I don&#39;t have the answer.
