Set the the stage for our listeners that are joining us from across the country in terms of how Alberta, and maybe let&#39;s start from the July 1 open for summer, greatest summer ever, perhaps even throw in your analogy that you used in the past, which I think is so apt, and then drive us to where we are right now in this fourth wave and the response we saw from our premier last night, Wednesday night here in Calgary.

But, you know, it&#39;s not necessarily a smart idea. It&#39;s very risky. And I think what we saw over the course of the summer was, yeah, it was risky and the downside came to be. And even at the time when we talked about it, we said, wow, he&#39;s really going all in on this. He&#39;s absolutely, you know, screwed if we end up in a really bad fourth wave. And well, here we are over the course of the start of August. And I guess I should mention at one point, the province was even going to just end contact tracing. seen yeah</span>

We&#39;re way over our base. The hospitals are full. Obviously, we&#39;re dealing with the same protests at hospitals as everybody else is. It just feels like the sky is falling. And even</span>

The pith of it is everything&#39;s in lockdown unless you use a vaccine passport system, and in which case you are allowed to open your business up again. But the frustration is now businesses have to make the choice about which of their customers they want to antagonize. Obviously, the vast majority of Albertans are supportive of vaccine passports, 80% or so. But that 20% can be pretty loud and pretty annoying. And so I think they would have preferred if the government just told them they had to do it.</span>

So at the end of the day, what we have, and Corey, thank you for this, I should say, is a province that has reacted Carter too late, that has started with some too little, too late measures a couple weeks ago, too little, too late and outright boneheaded. Maybe I&#39;ll clarify measures with a hundred dollar gift card. Now is introduced a blanket set of restrictions that go into effect on Monday. Announced them. Let&#39;s well, and we&#39;ll get to the timing in a second in the in the federal sort of election ramifications. Carter, let&#39;s stick to Alberta for now and talk about this a bit more. And for our listeners, maybe outside of the province, can you add the politics? Can you give us a sense of the politics of wanting to be the first to open, let&#39;s start where Corey started his story, all the way to perhaps the dithering and the lack of response and perhaps absence leading up to yesterday, which is still considered by many, based on other jurisdictions, a half measure. So give us a sense of the politics and analyst mode before we get into the strategy side of things a little bit further on.</span>

And when you do that, you no longer govern. And instead, you become a dictatorial type of an organization that&#39;s just pretending things to be the way that they wish.

So give me your take. Do you agree with Carter that, and Carter, I know there was a very impassioned, you know, plea at the end. But the headline that, if I can summarize, was politics by ideology or governing by ideology. Corey, do you agree that that is what&#39;s led to wanting to be the first to open up, perhaps dithering and delaying, and seeing this pattern that we have seen with the premier now in our fourth province-wide state of health emergency?</span>

We had cabinet ministers speaking out against the things that the premier had been doing. Obviously, he had lost his chief of staff earlier in the year. The UCP had been trailing the NDP in the polls for, I don&#39;t know, eight months at that point.</span>

They seem to be restrictions written by committee, or restrictions written by a lot of input. You know, certain, whether it&#39;s words that they&#39;re trying to avoid using certain constituencies and folks that they&#39;re trying to appease. Walk me through with your Alberta political history and campaign strategy hat, knowing what, you know, broadly that UCP caucus looks like. What do you see from these restrictions? And what do they kind of say about the political dynamic that Jason Kenney&#39;s trying to, I hate to use this word because he&#39;s doing it unsuccessfully, balance. Yeah,</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I think that you hit the nail on the head when you say it&#39;s restrictions built by committee. It definitely feels like there are competing visions for what this should be that are resting within the policy that the government of Alberta threw out there, and they are trying to fix it with communications. And they have broken their brains in the process because none of it holds together anymore. And as they&#39;re talking about it, just this word salad ballot comes out and you know i guarantee you everybody who was watching the news conference yesterday would not know what the state of play was right now were it not for the fact that they could then go and look at a website after and try to decipher it and try to figure it out and i can guarantee that because they actually contradicted themselves at different points in it and we don&#39;t need to get into it but one of them was around distancing for example two meters was that just for the moment was that included in the vaccine thing a lot of a lot of unclarity on this ultimately what they brought out zane was</span>

Even before we get to the mother of all exemptions, which is instead of just saying, or you can have a vaccine passport, right? They&#39;ve said, now we have all of these restrictions, but we have this restriction exemption program, which is, by the way, not a good name in addition to being confusing. It really sounds unsafe. Like if you are an employer and you&#39;re sitting there saying, I&#39;m going to tell all of my staff that they can come back to work under the restriction exemption program it actually sounds like you&#39;re putting them in an unsafe situation right but they were so desperate to make it seem like i</span>

Let&#39;s go to today, because today, Jason Kenney&#39;s ramifications, the blast zone of Alberta in this election really made itself present. We talk about Alberta&#39;s impact being negligible with the seats that we have here. here. Carter, I think it&#39;s safe to say that Alberta&#39;s impact, as Corey has said many times on this podcast, and I believe you have as well, is less about the seats, more about the issues. And here we are, Carter, endgame, Aaron O&#39;Toole. Did Jason Kenney just play fuck his buddy to Aaron O&#39;Toole announcing this on a Wednesday night, digested by the entire country on Thursday? I look at National News Watch right now to what Corey pointed us to. Six stories at the top, Top five of them are about this province. This is defining O&#39;Toole in many ways, at least from the way I see it.</span>

Right. Act three weeks earlier. You know, all of a sudden, O&#39;Toole&#39;s got the ability to deal with this. Maybe Trudeau fucks it up.

            <span class="text">well the simple answer is because those two have been tied closely on on many issues but even this issue now interestingly enough aaron o&#39;toole made those comments i remember when he made them and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it was in the start of the second wave um it was the fall and at the time it looked like it and i think it&#39;s still the time we had the most deaths in alberta like we were it was looking pretty grim i might might be wrong about that. But either way, it was, it was comments that already didn&#39;t seem accurate. But it did seem that those comments were maybe based on stale data, because Alberta did really well in the first wave, especially relative to people dying in nursing homes in Quebec and in comparable situations. So I always felt like in some ways, Aaron O&#39;Toole needs to update his briefing materials more regularly when he made that comment. But the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">fact that he made that comment. The fact that he&#39;s been to Alberta, the fact that he stood in front of the legislature and said, let&#39;s take Canada back, that he stood with Jason Kenney, who endorsed him for leader of the CPC, that&#39;s the challenge for him. It makes them a little bit closer. And I&#39;m sure the liberals would really like a conflating of the two positions, right? And certainly Aaron O&#39;Toole has done everything to support that, up to and including not answering a question that was apparently asked of him 11 times it would be i think smart if he had said no i don&#39;t i made those comments at a very different time alberta did very well in the first wave right</span>

And that&#39;s a weird question to me, can I just say as an aside, because Justin Trudeau is the prime minister, and this happened.

But Carter, to this question that Corey&#39;s put on the table, I need to ask you in a parallel universe. If Jason Kenney does not show up last night, Wednesday night, if Jason Kenney doesn&#39;t give that 6 p.m. news conference, if he just sits on his hands until Tuesday, says, fuck it, it&#39;s going to be the federal election, People in Alberta will be mad with me. What&#39;s different? Does that actually make it worse than the situation is right now for O&#39;Toole?</span>

And if I&#39;m honest, I&#39;m not sure how much better Jason Kenney made it for himself. If he holds off and does this on the 21st of September or the 22nd of September,</span>

Schools are going to explode anyways. All of the things that are going to that are bad that are going to happen by next week are still going to happen by next week. He would have put off the recovery for five or six days. But frankly, he&#39;s put off the recovery from this situation for over six weeks. He&#39;s put off the recovery from this since we all spotted that, hey, after Stampede, things don&#39;t look that good. And he declared that Stampede was great. I seem to recall Alberta Health Services and the people associated with, you know, health care in the province of Alberta saying the stampede was fine. We didn&#39;t have any problems with stampede. Well, OK, maybe the stampede was fine. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not here to I&#39;m not here to trace everything back. But it feels like things aren&#39;t great. And it feels like that was a catalytic moment where things started to take hold. So I don&#39;t know. Who cares if it&#39;s another five days? I mean, at this point, I really am asking the question, why didn&#39;t he wait? i mean cory&#39;s right the right time to do this was a minimum of three weeks ago right ideally this would happen just before the writ was dropped because i&#39;ll tell you something two days after the writ is dropped no one&#39;s going to remember this situation um we&#39;re in the middle of summer you know cory&#39;s workplace doesn&#39;t have this issue people weren&#39;t thinking they&#39;d get back to work september 1st was a key date and the fucking</span>

And if I was Aaron O&#39;Toole, that would be the question I&#39;d be asking Jason Kenney. And frankly, there is no good answer. I mean, is Jason Kenney actually an agent of Rachel Notley, who has been sent to destroy the conservative movement in Canada? One has to ask that. that.</span>

There&#39;s a lot of rumors around the fact that, you know, and I think you&#39;re the one who said who said this before, Corey, that we&#39;ve got a three stage process. Step one, too little too late with the measures. Step two, some sort of caucus response slash quasi revolt. Step three, the right measures or the necessary measures is multiple weeks late. We&#39;re now in step two. And perhaps what, you know, led to step one here was the fact that, you know, he wanted to try to minimize the impact of what the caucus or the ministerial sort of blowback could be from his UCP caucus.</span>

It seems like this question will keep dogging him.

Like, as Albertans and how all-consuming this is, it seems absolutely outrageous somebody wouldn&#39;t be prepared to talk about this. But even though it&#39;s leading in national news today, it&#39;s still an Alberta story, and so perhaps they were hoping it would stay somewhat local. but let me tell you when you&#39;re on a campaign when you&#39;re in a war room when you&#39;re running those things day by day sometimes</span>

            <span class="text">Kinda. That is a pretty decent metaphor for this campaign, I&#39;d say. O&#39;Toole, I should say, Trudeau has not dunked on Kenny today. What advice would you have for Trudeau going forward as it relates to this particular situation in Alberta? He can he just can&#39;t have a shit eating grin about it. But what does he need to do strategically as a team to try to leverage this, maximize it beyond what they&#39;ve done today, which is the tying of Kenny to O&#39;Toole, which seems to be the strategic pumping up of a George Shahal campaign video on Twitter where Shahal made the early days of the campaign tying Kenny to O&#39;Toole. And now it seems like strategically everyone in the liberal camp is pumping that video up. But outside of those couple of tactics, what does Trudeau need to do to sustain this connection, to sustain this story in the endgame heading into Monday?</span>

I&#39;m not entirely convinced this is going to be the top story on Saturday in the rest of Canada. That&#39;s just how things go, unless things get even worse here in Alberta. But it does make sense to continue to be pointing out those connections behind the scenes. It does make sense to continue to try to draw Aaron O&#39;Toole to it, to highlight the fact that he doesn&#39;t even want to answer the questions about Jason Kenney. As long as Aaron O&#39;Toole continues to take the approach he took today, the Liberals have an opportunity on it. This is one of those things that probably would have burned itself out if they had taken a different approach earlier in the day. And so be</span>

Corey, let&#39;s end with Alberta&#39;s leader of the opposition. We are here here in Alberta. She&#39;s getting a lot of national media attention because of this story, because of the election. I&#39;m sure she would have otherwise as well as a former premier. What advice would you have for Rachel Notley here? Because part of me, and I haven&#39;t seen this, but I sense it. Part of me feels like the NDs here in Alberta are almost kind of putting on the brakes. Like, let&#39;s be kind of gentle with Kenny. Let&#39;s not get to the point where we screw screw ourselves in 2023 by pushing them out. Now, this is just one man&#39;s interpretation of what I see. But what advice would you have for them, whether you acknowledge my point or not in your response, as they look at this moment, this critical moment, and we haven&#39;t talked a lot about the local politics for Kenny and his downfall, because I want to keep it federal. But what advice would you have for her in these endgame stages where the spotlight will shine on her a bit as well, if not nationally, then certainly in Alberta?</span>

I just I&#39;m not interested in that conversation from a pure politics point of view. That&#39;s the stuff that campaign ads are made of right now. And so at a certain point, do you really want to push him over the edge? Do you do you really want to knock him out of there? and maybe have to deal with a conservative leader who has some opportunity to rebuild, to distance from Jason Kenney, try to put all of the garbage out with the past leader, right?</span>

You don&#39;t want to necessarily step in it, maybe be accused of cheering on the province having failure in the health care system. You don&#39;t want to be perceived as somebody who is just being too politically calculating on it. So maybe you just sort of step back a bit and take on more of the serious tone of, oh, my goodness, yes, it&#39;s a very difficult situation in Alberta. and so it&#39;s tough to assess the strategy in in this moment in isolation because of the seriousness of the moment right we&#39;ll get a better sense of it in the next couple of weeks couple of months because if the ndp continue to treat him with kid gloves like this i think it&#39;s an indication that they&#39;re actually worried that you know he&#39;s he&#39;s just swaying there and if they just give a light breeze in his direction he might fall on the mat have to deal with someone else carter</span>

Let&#39;s talk about the endorsements as well, because we got Kretchen endorsing Trudeau, Hazel McCallum endorsing Trudeau, and then quickly after when reporters find her saying, oh, we shouldn&#39;t be having this election. You had Mulroney, who&#39;s now endorsing O&#39;Toole. But let&#39;s talk about O&#39;Toole&#39;s endgame strategy here, Carter. Carter. He&#39;s picking the PC lane.

What do you think of this strategy, both from the Mulrooney side of it, but now solidifying that, OK, and it&#39;s five days. So granted, it&#39;s not like he&#39;s been doing this for weeks.

What else are these people going to fucking do? But with the discontent that we&#39;re seeing in the prairie provinces, with the pandering to Quebec, now to, you know, extending on your point, wearing the PC flag with an endorsement from a PC prime minister, what&#39;s the risk here to O&#39;Toole, Carter? Like, could we be sitting here on election day, eating crow and saying, shit, this guy got, you know, a solid minority, if not majority, we&#39;re using this PC lane? Or are we going to be saying, what a fucking idiot, he could see the right flank was leaking for three weeks, and he did nothing to shore it up? What&#39;s the risk here in your mind?</span>

The truth of the matter is, there are more votes in the center than there is in the right. So you move to the center to pick up those votes. That&#39;s where the people are. People don&#39;t care as much about policy as we think they do. But they do care about extremes.

Right. The plan there absolutely is to say like, hey, this is totally cool. You should let me park here. But voters are leery. They&#39;re suspicious.
