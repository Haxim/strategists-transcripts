        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk Jason Kenney's upcoming leadership review. Has a balanced budget and high price of oil helped Kenney? Is 2900 registrants (and counting) for the vote a worrying sign? And has there ever been a segment more likely to get Stephen Carter cancelled than "Sweet Nothings"? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

          <div class="said">okay yeah carter I know you shy away from work. We&#39;ve got a lot to talk about. We&#39;re going to focus the bulk of our attention to our home province here in Alberta. Let&#39;s make it to our first segment. Our first segment, making sense of all the horseshit. Oh, guys, there is so much going on. There is the price of oil. There is the Kenny Leadership Review. There is the early election rumor mill that keeps churning out more. Well, what does a rumor mill churn out generally? Heat? Noise? Electricity? It&#39;s turning out noise, heat, and electricity. But where should we start, guys? I want to start with, you know, perhaps going back a little bit to what has made this interesting, which is the budget and the price of oil. And Corey, you know, we are now seeing the price of oil in Alberta near record, if not at record highs. Give me your reflections on that from the political perspective that is Jason Kenney&#39;s survivability heading into April 9th.</div>

          <div class="said">well um the most obvious answer is it&#39;s good for it because it provides him both a balanced budget which is good for him and it provides money that you can then splash around not to mention even if you step outside of government land it means profits are up for a lot of oil and gas companies it it means all sorts of money is splashing around alberta in a way that it hasn&#39;t been for a few years here so price of oil short term pretty good uh for the province of alberta you You have, I mean, WCS, literally, literally two years ago, people</div>

          <div class="said">provincial budget moves on oil and gas so if you ever want to balance the provincial budget without incurring pain, then you have to hope and pray for high oil and gas prices. That has been the pattern that has existed since, you know, Peter Lougheed. And the Alberta advantage that Ralph Klein always talked about was a low tax environment offset with a high resource revenue environment. So if you want to be popular like Ralph Klein, who got 55% in his his last leadership review, then yes, you can, in fact, just count on high oil prices. And so maybe high oil prices will give him the requirement he needs on April the 9th. But high oil and gas prices in and of itself are not some sort of magic recipe for happiness within the province of Alberta. We have been unhappy before in booms when we don&#39;t think that we&#39;re being served properly. Alice in Redford, you know, barely hung on. And in 2012, we barely won that election over Danielle Smith, because people didn&#39;t like the way we were managing our oil and gas revenue. There are many, many challenges that come with having a balanced budget. Or so it&#39;s balanced now. But if we were to look into Corey&#39;s cracked crystal ball about where we&#39;re going to be moving in the future, one imagines a significant surplus in in the next budget that comes just before the election. And by significant, just to put just to put a frame around it, we&#39;re talking five to ten billion dollars or more or more because no one projected. So, this</div>

And so WCS is the price of a barrel that&#39;s pretty heavy and pretty sour in Hardesty, Alberta. WTI is a barrel that&#39;s pretty light and pretty sweet in Cushing, Oklahoma.

          <div class="said">I want to talk to you about if the product has an impact in this leadership review. Here&#39;s where I was trying to get to with this question after getting your initial comments, which is we&#39;ve often talked about how for many heading into April 9th, the date of Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership review, viability will be for his ongoing leadership will probably be based on a couple of metrics. And you guys have brought up polls quite often. Has he bottomed out and is he rising in the polls? Does he sense that we&#39;re now going up? The question I have is, does this recent budget and the associated price of oil, which are interlinked, right, to be very clear, are interlinked for our listeners across the country in many ways, does that override things like the polls? Does that override things like the membership counts? Like, how good is this news for Jason Kenney is what I&#39;m trying to get to. And maybe I&#39;ll kind of throw a double barrel question here, oil pun intended, which is, if you are wanting to replace Jason Kenney, if you are someone who&#39;s thinking about it, flirting with it, and you&#39;re going to see that this surplus may be bigger, that these macroeconomic conditions may just go on, is it now a great time to get rid of them? You can back yourself into the same, quote unquote, good economy that he might have as a gift on the back end of this review. So I wanted to get that sense. How good of news is this? And then let&#39;s talk about the alternatives from the political side. Corey, I&#39;ll let you take a stab at that first. Yeah,</div>

          <div class="said">that sense. Yeah. It takes some of the credit away because we&#39;re all talking about the price of oil. Like if we weren&#39;t talking about the price of oil, he could have maybe seized a little bit more of that. The other problem is, and I mentioned this or hinted at this, was the gas pumps. It&#39;s much more expensive. Our bills, when we get our heating bills here in Alberta, most heating is done by natural gas. Well, that&#39;s also going to be something that people&#39;s eyes pop out of their head and say, what the fuck? How is this so expensive? And then cost of living becomes a consideration as well. And there is an NDP opposition that will very ably beat them to death on the cost of living arguments, right? Which is, I think, why Jason Kenney has made some comments about looking for ways to reduce the price of gasoline for Albertans over the next bit here. Carter,</div>

I think we, you both, I shouldn&#39;t say we three, but you both had stated that that is more than likely the bar he was going to go with.

I&#39;m going to abide by that because I think that that&#39;s in the best interest of the party, and that&#39;s what the members wanted. They easily could have set it at 65, 68, 78. It could have been any of those numbers. They chose 50% plus one because in our party, we respect democracy. democracy. He skipped that part, and he just did the 50% plus one is the rules, and I&#39;m going to follow the rules. Kind of a weak moment for him, because I think that he could have done it a lot better.

Would he possibly give? it&#39;s not it&#39;s not something where you&#39;re going to set a bar higher for yourself that you need to jump over because you&#39;re going to want to be able to adjust like let&#39;s just say he said it was 65 and then he gets 64 well of course he&#39;s going to stick around at 64 except he just killed himself by by saying that it had to be 65 previously so i think even leaders who understand that they need more than a bare majority of their party in order to ably govern would just give the number 50 plus plus one so as much as i love taking superfluous victory lapses i mean this is not credit to us this is the obvious public</div>

I&#39;ve seen all the kids come off the buses from the Catholic private schools in rural Alberta. I&#39;ve seen, you know, I&#39;ve seen them attack, you know, Sandra Jansen. If, you know, Jason Kenney can organize big numbers. So if I&#39;m on Team Rebel, I&#39;m making telephone calls saying we are behind. We are, but we&#39;re in it. We are 100 votes back. We can totally get ahead of this thing. We need the numbers to be 6,000 if we&#39;re going to be able to compete because that guy can pull 3,000 votes minimum.

Things have been lining up, both on timing and on message. But two things I want you to address as leader of the official rebel opposition, which is number one, he&#39;s characterizing this as a moderate conservative himself versus a far right. Curious to get your take on that messaging. And number two, he&#39;s talking about the economic growth under his watch. How are you undermining both of those points?</div>

Like if he wins the leadership, you hear 55% examples and it&#39;s probably the best one. 55% Jason Kenney wins he still loses some people who essentially walk to the other side of the house, they lose a confidence vote, they immediately go into an election. That is one I could see I don&#39;t think it&#39;s high probability the higher probability early election is that a new leader is selected in June, the new leader or July or whenever the hell they pick it and then the new leader says I was not elected, I need need a mandate and they ride that that significant piece and sometime in september october we have another election and then of course the third most and and the most likely in my mind election time is the uh is the the set date in in april of 2020 2020 whatever it is three four to three</div>

And I expect it to be unanimous from my side of the caucus, or else there&#39;s just no point in doing this, right? Right. Really try to raise the stakes even beyond kind of a literal confidence vote, I think, but make it exclusively about confidence in Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership. Right. All of these clouds over this, how ambiguous this is, you know, this leadership review, which, you know, is in the future. Like all of this impedes me from being able to do the things I need to do for Alberta. And the higher you can make the stakes on those things for Alberta, the better. I think some stuff around pipelines would be him going back to a well he&#39;s gone to many, many times. if you want to talk about negotiating the end of RCMP providing provincial policing perhaps that becomes one if you want to talk about an Alberta pension plan perhaps that becomes one I think those two are perhaps too unpopular to go into a general election on though so my suspicion is it would have to be something that was more universally</div>

What&#39;s good for Alberta today leads towards things being worse for Alberta in a shorter term. Germany is talking about a 15-year ramp up on its removal of fossil fuels. fuels. We&#39;re going to see car companies moving. You know, they were 2030, they were trying to sell more electric vehicles than fossil fuels. Watch that shift. Watch that shift to 2028, 2027.

          <div class="said">Corey, I&#39;m going to go to you for our final question, then, of course, to Stephen. Corey, real estate in this country is expensive. We know that. But nothing, nothing sometimes is better than a good deal. And I think I&#39;ve got a good deal for you. It is an island property, two-floor, on a location called Kenny Island. And Corey, this particular cabana, I mean, beautiful views. You purchase now, Sunday, March 6th. I can give you possession Possession, maybe on March, no, April 10th is when I can give you possession. April 10th. Now, I don&#39;t know if anything&#39;s happening on the 9th, but April 10th, I can give you possession. Corey, are you putting the money down today on this extreme value that you can buy on Kenny Island with possession date being April 10th? Are you buying yes or no?</div>
