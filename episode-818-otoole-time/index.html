        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the election of Erin O'Toole as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada. Did the delayed results give the CPC a black eye? What does Erin O'Toole do now? And did anybody watch O'Toole's speech? Because we absolutely did not and we're hoping it doesn't negate anything we said here. Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Guys, let&#39;s talk about what we saw with the conservative leadership race. I know we have a new leader for the conservative party. We&#39;ll park that for a second because I think what&#39;s become the story was this process. And maybe, Corey, I&#39;ll start with you getting your initial thoughts on on what was initially reported a couple hours before the 4 p.m., at least for us, 4 p.m., Mountain, 6 p.m. Eastern time slot, as a 90-minute delay that turned out to be, oh, I don&#39;t know, a seven-hour delay. Give me your overarching thoughts on what the fuck you just saw. And how charitable should we be to the Conservative Party? Maybe those two questions.</div>

          <div class="said">they ended up in a situation where they had to then manually reissue ballots because of of course, there&#39;s the barcode I mentioned, right? And so to get to the next step, you need to reprint a ballot, which means you&#39;ve got to invalidate another ballot.</div>

          <div class="said">deeply embarrassing for the Conservative Party. This is the same system they used last time to open ballots, but now they&#39;re using smaller envelopes. And either one of two things happened. The one I suspect is they did test it and it has a failure rate of about oh i don&#39;t know three percent which is what people are reporting is is the you know the number of ballots that were sliced open and they just you know the ones they test it didn&#39;t get mangled in any way shape or form you also you can&#39;t put anything past the voter to wreck the process and put the ballot in wrong and do all of those things right um but the other possibility is they didn&#39;t test it and they just changed the ballot size So it&#39;s embarrassing, and I think that if you work at the Conservative Party headquarters and you now have new leader Aaron O&#39;Toole, you&#39;re definitely making sure that you&#39;re finding all of your LinkedIn is up to date and you&#39;ve brushed up your resume because there&#39;s no way the new leader is coming in with a good taste in their mouth about the operations at the Conservative HQ.

          <div class="said">It is exactly the same. We&#39;re waiting for you, 15 minutes late, Belgium. But this is the mistake. Problems happen in leadership and counting. I mean, leaders get announced at four o&#39;clock in the morning. McGinty is announced at four thirty in the morning. We remember Iowa for the Iowa primary, which was a shit show. The Democratic Party has somehow managed to recover from that and pull slightly in the lead of Donald Trump. These things don&#39;t matter, except that the the problem to me was not saying we&#39;ve got a problem. We don&#39;t know when we&#39;re going to have it fixed, but we&#39;re committing to having it fixed tonight. And we&#39;re going to give the networks 45 minutes notice or something along those lines, which would allow them to break away from their seven hours of coverage. This is where the two problems occurred, where Scheer got up and said, don&#39;t trust the mainstream media that we&#39;re broadcasting this thing live with like no economic incentive to do so.

So those two things compounded to create a real problem that was, you know, yeah, there was an error. I mean, errors happen. That&#39;s the reality of leadership campaigns. This is not, that&#39;s not the mistake that was made tonight. night the real mistake was telling the media 15 minutes 30 minutes an hour an hour and a half two hours like that was bullshit and even the last 15 minute warning was bullshit and then the gap between the first and second ballots was</div>

          <div class="said">don&#39;t think so not in any kind of real way not in any kind of long-term way one of the nice things about a leadership contest zane is there&#39;s a whole new boss in town and they They get to bring in their people and they can say, oh, those were the fuck-ups under Scheer. That&#39;s not what&#39;s going to happen under Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s leadership. So, you know, they get a bit of a pass on any party operations that go wrong on leadership days. And they go wrong so consistently. I would suggest more often than not, leadership results get delayed. And we, the media, everybody should just stop kidding themselves. These results are going to come in late. They always do. I think about how long it took the in-between ballots in the leadership for the NDP where Mulcair was elected. Sure. Agony. Even Jason Kenney, when he got the leadership of the UCP more recently in Alberta, very late results. It&#39;s just it happens because there are so many things that go into a leadership contest beyond the counting of the ballots that exacerbate these things. Now, you know, it&#39;s not wrong, though, what Stephen said about how they manage the issue wrong. And I really do mean, I think some people probably need to think about whether they&#39;ve got future employment with the CPC going forward because this was a really bad performance by them.</div>

And so let&#39;s talk to the media and let&#39;s regroup on this thing. because the idea of just stringing everybody along for so long is the most infuriating way to deal with that.

          <div class="said">you know, every leadership contest is its own special little creation. They&#39;re snowflakes, right? They have different rules, they have different technologies. And there&#39;s two things I can say about that. One is it&#39;s very hard to pass judgment as a result standing somewhere else you know what we did at the time i ran a leadership contest was use technology literally in this exact same way it had been used in other leadership contests to try to minimize the amount that something could go wrong on that front and then we hired a former chief electoral officer to be our you know auditor you know we just really tried to belt and suspenders it and avoid any kind of great grief um but if you were trying to even when you&#39;re doing that I have some sympathy. So they went to smaller envelopes. We went to a different system we had in Alberta. The origins of the Liberal Party&#39;s supporter system, the idea that you can just register as a registered Liberal and vote and everything, that started in Alberta. And the leadership contest I ran was the first one we did that. And it&#39;s different. I mean, there are so many different complications that go in there. So even when you&#39;re relying on tested and true technologies, things can and will go wrong. And there will be delays. And there will be angry leadership contestants. That&#39;s just the reality of the system. So I say all of this.</div>

If the conservatives were to heed his recommendations, I think both members and party, like, let&#39;s focus on these outlets, that would be effing terrible advice. And it would pull them away from the mainstream that they need to get elected. Here&#39;s the bottom line with Andrew Scheer. He almost became prime minister, despite himself. He did win the popular vote, but for a few seats, he would be prime minister. But he has to take responsibility for his failures here. He exaggerated his employment and his education. And worse than that, he walked into an election with those things still hidden and holding over his head. So he&#39;s got to accept a certain responsibility and not just blame the media for this. And the conservatives need to – and I think the conservatives are savvy enough and I think Aaron O&#39;Toole and the people around him are savvy enough to know you&#39;re</div>

How did he end up in a situation where he didn&#39;t just lose narrowly? This was the O&#39;Toole strategy in the sense, hey, let&#39;s just chip away, ensure we&#39;re close on the first ballot. They were very close on the first ballot. And then And by the third ballot, it was a significant margin. I think 3,000 or 5,000 in between there. You may want to correct me. But this was not a small, let&#39;s just sneak it through on the third ballot. He killed him on that last one.

You know, she&#39;s going to be, I think, the secondary storyline of this. And in some cases, she might even be the primary storyline. line. So she&#39;s going to be a big opportunity. And her votes, because her votes went to O&#39;Toole and Sloan&#39;s votes ultimately went to O&#39;Toole. There&#39;s a real strong sense that you helped get them there. And so her voters and the people who are supporting her and Sloan, I think will feel represented in this decision.

Then the social conservatives flanking him to the right, Peter McKay flanking him a bit to the left. All four of them ran to the right, to Corey&#39;s point, which is how do you think this is problematic, if at all, for O&#39;Toole now that he has to come out of this, has a a coalition that feels like they predominantly are responsible for getting them over the top, the social conservatives. How does this translate when we consistently, you know, after the halo effect and the glow of today for the conservatives might look at themselves tomorrow and be like, oh, fuck, now we have a viability problem again, because we&#39;ve got this group disproportionately propping us up. How do they kind of look at this from the broader perspective of the next election?

We were focused on bringing in people who shared our values. And we thought that there was a bigger group out there than just the conservatives. Now, I would argue, given how the conservatives have performed in elections since Stephen Harper has left as leader, that they don&#39;t have right now the ability to appeal to people who aren&#39;t identifying as conservative. And that&#39;s where the strategic tradeoff has to happen. Is O&#39;Toole prepared now to say, I&#39;m going to go find the voters that I wish to appeal to? Or is he going to take the Andrew Scheer model and say, the people People we really need to be talking to are reading True North and reading the Postmillennial and subscribing to Rebel News. Because if that&#39;s all you speak to, if that&#39;s your vote universe, you&#39;re not going to make it. And there was polls published this week that said, you know, 49% of Canadians are prepared to vote for the Conservative Party.</div>

And, you know, he&#39;s a former Air Force captain, he&#39;s a lawyer, he&#39;s an MP. And when you talk about vote universe, Stephen, two things I would say about that. One is 49% would be a bad number for the liberals. It would be a bad number for the new Democrats. It&#39;s not so far off where the conservatives usually are when they win, because the conservatives do tend to see their vote as more mutually exclusive, right?

So let&#39;s talk about some of those players that we saw. Derek Sloan, what does he do first? Just very quickly on him. him. He actually outperformed what many people were thinking as well. Does he have some sort of leverage or credibility? Carter, if you were advising Derek Sloan, which I know you would take in a heartbeat as a gig, but he comes to you, he says, listen, I performed much better on that first ballot than many people thought. People thought I was a write-off and a candidate that wasn&#39;t going to win. Well, I didn&#39;t win, but I performed quite well. What leverage do I have?

I would almost be saying like, oh, I don&#39;t speak French and then busting out near perfect French in a year&#39;s time as a result. Just be like, oh, this? No, I mean, this isn&#39;t really French. I&#39;ve got a lot to go still, right? Try to manage expectations around there. And when this next election comes around, you want to make sure that you&#39;re positioned to gracefully move into the front benches of either Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s shadow cabinet or cabinet, depending on how things play out.</div>

And she&#39;s taken a lot of the hits. Lewis won&#39;t want to do that. She&#39;s going to have to put herself in a position where she&#39;s above some of the fray, and she is as seen as the shining light that needs to be protected. And the best way for her to do that is to become the number one lieutenant to the now leader of the Conservative Party. She needs that positioning right away because the worst thing that could happen to her is that she&#39;s forgotten in six months, and it could happen. Who was she? There was a woman. That could happen, right? We have a tremendously short memory. We don&#39;t remember these things well.

It looks like you&#39;ve got a pretty good team in Quebec, so there&#39;s something to build from.

He has the opportunity to define the Conservative Party totally differently. And then I would also advise him to look for any opportunity, any false step from Sloan, because he would be easy to throw overboard and say, this does not define the Conservative Party moving forward. Because defining what you&#39;re not at this point could be as important as defining what you are. Because Because as long as you&#39;re carrying around the baggage that Sloan&#39;s going to bring, I think it&#39;s going to be very difficult to define what the party looks like for the future.</div>

          <div class="said">Well, my advice isn&#39;t very different from Stephen&#39;s. I agree completely about Sloan, and I think this is part of solving a bigger mental block Canadians may have with the Conservative Party right now, which is this concept that perhaps it&#39;s become a little bit too right-wing, a little bit too beholden to ideals of the past and not ideals of the present or hopefully future. So you may need to have a fight with Sloan at some point, even orchestrate one. So when I was saying if I&#39;m Sloan, I go a little slow, I don&#39;t go too far, too fast.</div>

You have to make the party not look unreasonable. And so on that front, you should consider whether there&#39;s a signature policy that, let&#39;s be honest, you don&#39;t, you have nowhere to go but down in a lot of these prairie provinces and you should take that. You should take that trade because you don&#39;t need to win with 30, 40, 50% margins in these ridings, right? So consider what your plan is for the environment, I think would be a big one. I think that would be a huge totem in the minds of Canadians. I am not saying carbon tax, because he&#39;s been pretty clear on that. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s incongruous to say, I think we need to act on the environment. I just don&#39;t believe the average person should have to pay for it.

          <div class="said">Carter, I want to pick up on this last thread of the O&#39;Toole angle, which is, you know, on the attacking Trudeau, defining Trudeau over the last couple of months has been almost squarely in the hands of someone like Pierre Polyarif, a.k.a. you have a pet name for him, which I&#39;ll repeat momentarily. uh but uh you know folks like that i&#39;ve got two questions for you how do you as a leader now the new leader of the party snatch away the mantle of of saying i want to be the principal attack dog a do you do that or do you leave someone like peer in that role so you can in the first couple of months can stay you know above the fray or uh to my second question related when do you do that if not now when are you as leader starting to go after trudeau is that immediately Is that after? And are you taking over the mantle of principal attack dog? Or do you leave someone like Pierre Polyev to kind of do his things on that side? Because a lot of this is going to be about framing Trudeau in these very vulnerable times heading between now and what&#39;s going to be the throne speech. And there&#39;s going to be a lot of activity we expect in between these, you know, right now and September 23rd throne speech as well. So I want to get your thoughts on that and the strategy leading up to now and then just setting that context. text okay</div>

          <div class="said">okay well first of all you leave the attack dogs this goes back to my point about michelle rempel is she&#39;s you know she&#39;s willing to carry your water then let her carry it she can go on all the television shows she can do the committee work she can make sure um that that she&#39;s attacking and she&#39;s defining the negative uh pierre is great at that as well um you know he his his attack lines uh perhaps should be refined under your new team that you&#39;re going to bring in to to run the official leader of the opposition&#39;s office. So you&#39;ll have better, ideally, you&#39;d have better lines, and you&#39;d have a more sustained attack on issues that matter to Canadians. But I</div>

I don&#39;t think O&#39;Toole&#39;s problem and the Conservative Party&#39;s problem is that they&#39;re not attacking Trudeau hard enough. I think that their problem is that they&#39;re still not presenting their vision for what Canada should look like and will look like like under their leadership. I mean, I know that they don&#39;t like a carbon tax, but what are they going to do about climate change? You know, O&#39;Toole has nodded towards taking an initiative on the climate. Well, what is it? What are you going to do? Because fixing the climate is not something that comes without a cost and consequence. So figure it out. Tell us what it is. And I think that that&#39;s where O&#39;Toole could really shine. And I&#39;ll tell you something. I know the Bloc Québécois want to have a confidence vote.</div>

          <div class="said">Well, you have to ground the policy in the values of the man, right? Right. So you have to ground the you know, I&#39;ve got a position on let me let me tell you why I value a hard day&#39;s work, you know, and the value of hard day&#39;s work and and the freedom of choice to go and have the job that you need to have to support your family. I was raised by blah, blah, blah. Right. Like whatever the the policy is, you have to be able to ground that in yourself and ground that ideally in something that is easily understandable. understandable uh and memorable so um you know one of the things i talk about frequently is is redford&#39;s branding positioning and how strong it was associated with her when she was uh you know mother of a young daughter daughter of aging parents that brand structure could accommodate any policy position so when we defined her we always told her story in those terms about how being a mother has made her focus on education or being a mother gave her these views on health care that brand structure of who you are as an individual then leads to the policy elements and if if if O&#39;Toole does that then he&#39;s in a really strong position if instead he just says the conservatives or you know the conservative party will never allow a carbon tax because carbon tax is bad you know I just don&#39;t think that that really binds him to the position and and makes the party his it&#39;s just it&#39;s rhetoric instead of instead of values</div>

          <div class="said">If they are not shitting their pants right now, then they don&#39;t understand Canadian elections. Really? First of all, it&#39;s not necessarily about Aaron O&#39;Toole. It&#39;s about newness. It&#39;s about shiny. It&#39;s about something. This is why I had Peter and Aaron as the same. I mean, Aaron&#39;s less known, I think, than Peter McKay was. But nonetheless, neither of them are as well known now as Trudeau was. Right. And it doesn&#39;t take a strong narrative to win over the Canadian populace. We will vote for anyone. So this this is a massive problem for the liberals. And they were in trouble already. So there&#39;s going to be a bump for the conservatives in the next round of polling, which is probably commencing tomorrow night. and we&#39;ll see how real this is. But the Liberals need to not fall in love with their recent polling. They need to decide that they&#39;re going to win the next election.</div>

They&#39;re going to say, oh, he&#39;s so right-wing. Canadians will see him as so right-wing. oh we got it now or there&#39;s some will i actually don&#39;t know if that will be the prevailing view obviously we&#39;re just taking guesses here but um that&#39;s not how it works to steven&#39;s point there&#39;s this question of newness he will seem reasonable relative if you think he&#39;s gang is gone coming in he&#39;s definitely not gang is gone and um and there&#39;s a lot of risk in that there&#39;s a lot of risk in that so they have to be very careful cory</div>
