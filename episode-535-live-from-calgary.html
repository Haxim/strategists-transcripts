Now, we already lead the nation in most of our provincial standards, but we don&#39;t talk about it enough. And now the New Democrats are in a position, if they adopt the framework of the Canadian energy strategy as it was devised, they actually have an opportunity to talk about the environment, shipping oil, getting oil across British Columbia or across the country or down into the United States.
