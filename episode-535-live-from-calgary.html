            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">so Corey and Carter talk to me about what the throne speech actually is because you know Corey you and I were chatting about this today and I&#39;m like is this equivalent of the state of the union in Canadian politics what exactly is the throne Let&#39;s put some foundational elements into place. Well,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s probably about as close as you can get. It&#39;s not precisely that, and really the government can decide exactly what they want it to be. It can be something that&#39;s aspirational, we choose to go to the moon, that kind of thing, or it can be a</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, and today you saw a throne speech that was a little bit different than some of the throne speeches before when Alison Redford did hers in 2012. We tried to make it more about what her policies were, the overall policies, He&#39;s not necessarily everything we were going to pass in the session. This was very unique in that it was only</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">predictable language. Okay, so you talk about the notion of having a throne speech as being something aspirational, something visionary.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="text">what did you guys witness today with the throne speech? And for people that are listening or in our audience or that may have missed it, Do you want to maybe give them a little bit of a summary of what you saw, and then secondly, what you thought? It was like the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the anti-aspirational speech, and that&#39;s not a knock. That&#39;s exactly what they wanted to do.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Because it is the NDP, and I think they had the same type of ideas. is. So what was there? It was a very straightforward speech from the throne. It had three bills. Is there, I mean, let&#39;s talk about those three bills, actually. Well, actually,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yes, do it. Lois Mitchell was sworn in as our new lieutenant governor on Friday, and her first act today was to read the throne speech, and I thought she was great. I actually thought that she really set a new tone that reminded me of Lois Hull, the last Lois, Lieutenant Governor.</span>

            <span class="text">You were saying, you said that this was straightforward. And yes, I get we have a new LG in place. But I want to talk about the content a little bit more. Because we were sitting around, huddled around a laptop trying to watch this thing. and it was over before we even knew it. There</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">more pageantry than there was speech. Yes. But the idea of it being exactly what it was, I&#39;ll tell you, it&#39;s because if they made it that big aspirational speech and then they went on summer vacation, I don&#39;t think that would go over particularly well. I think that this is exactly what the speech needed. So Carter, tell us what there was, just for some context.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

I mean, there was an interesting tying in, And as Corey has mentioned, to the previous governments that have governed Alberta. But except the PCs. No, they mentioned the PCs.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">likes law here. But I think it was very quick and very to the point. So you saw an explanation of Bill 1. They&#39;re going to stop corporate and union donations and maybe some other stuff. So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">they threw in the end maybe some other stuff. Then they talked about Bill 2, which is we&#39;re all paying more taxes. But don&#39;t worry, it won&#39;t be the highest taxes in Canada or anything crazy like that. And then they did Bill 3, which was really all about the stable and predictable funding of anything you may care about. So health care, education,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">don&#39;t worry, everything else is coming in the fall. And then they did a laundry list of things that were priorities,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">priorities, I suppose they could say. So it was an interesting way for them to put out their priorities without actually having to do anything on them. What&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that the real danger is you forget why you&#39;re actually elected to government. You&#39;re not actually elected to government to pass these two supply, you know, the tax and supply bill and the eliminating of corporate and union donations. You&#39;re actually elected to government to have a vision. And that vision should be longer than a few bills. That vision should be, this is what we&#39;d like our society to actually look like.

It was also devised to talk about the environment. Developing provincial standards in Alberta that led the nation. Now, we already lead the nation in most of our provincial standards, but we don&#39;t talk about it enough. And now the New Democrats are in a position, if they adopt the framework of the Canadian energy strategy as it was devised, they actually have an opportunity to talk about the environment, shipping oil, getting oil across British Columbia or across the country or down into the United States.
