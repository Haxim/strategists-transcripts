Like, haven&#39;t we by now through all of the midterm elections and the general elections and the data modeling that goes with all of that and the identification of just a few people that you can then extrapolate the opinions of many people? Do we actually need in 2024 in the United States to go to every fucking door to identify whether you&#39;re likely to vote for Harris or for Trump? My suspicion is no. And so in a funny way, I think Donald Trump may have through sheer incompetence stumbled upon an efficiency, right? Instead of spending so much time and effort on ground game, he&#39;s realized, I&#39;ve got the vote pretty well ID&#39;d. I can just turn on the machinery in different ways on election day and what is now election season to get everybody to the fucking polls. Like what?

There&#39;s a whole sub-narrative in the progressive universe right now that is is starting to say that part out loud over the last week, I&#39;m not saying universally, but there&#39;s a lot of people starting to be like, Trump&#39;s got this thing, right? Like the Harry Entens of the world, the Nate Silvers with their gut feeling post in the New York Times of the world, right? Which is stupid because the guy is literally supposed to be rooted in data. But anyways, he gives us this, what I thought was a confirmation bias piece in my opinion. But Corey, do you feel like Trump is ahead here? here?
