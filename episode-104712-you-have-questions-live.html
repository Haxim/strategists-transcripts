          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">oh I doubt I mean I think that the courting is essentially in a funny way, nagging, like, your party&#39;s irrelevant, so come join us, right? And the simple reality, and Stephen talked a bit about it on one of his slides, any poll that shows the Alberta Liberal Party at 6%, are they going to run in 6% of the ridings? That&#39;s not a realistic number. And I have to imagine that&#39;s the 6% of people who are perpetually confused and thought it was a federal liberal poll.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">You can look at polling going back to the 70s, about 6% of Americans Americans say the moon landing has been faked for about 50 years like there&#39;s a six percent problem in polling because they&#39;re they don&#39;t have anywhere to go but the NDP um yeah I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s a lot of courting the Alberta party is an interesting one for me because you might have seen that their leader said he was not going to run in Brooks Medicine Hat and he was mayor of Brooks so I&#39;m not sure where he&#39;s going to have a better shot I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

So every election at universities across the province, there is some sort of get-out-the-vote campaign of varying and often dubious impact. So this election season, I would argue, there&#39;s a lot of reason for university students to be pretty angry with the tuition increases over the last few years and cuts in funding kind of across the board. Do you think there&#39;s any room in the NDP strategy to try and get more student voters out to the polls, especially at, like, UFC, MRU, Lethbridge, and those more kind of competitive areas?</span>

            <span class="text">We&#39;ve got a bit of an example from British Columbia that can remind us all of what the constitutional rules at play are here, but that&#39;s tough. It&#39;s tough to run a government. There&#39;s two things to keep in mind, though. One is there&#39;s the legislature and there&#39;s the passing of legislation, and that becomes almost impossible in a 44-43 split if the government does the speaker, because then every vote&#39;s 43-43, the speaker by convention is supposed to vote to maintain the status quo. Doesn&#39;t drop confidence, but means you&#39;re not passing a lot of things.</span>

I want to be in cabinet and things would get crazy in a hurry and it would be very unstable And I do think we&#39;d be back to an election in like a year because even if the government was surviving They would say this sucks and I want a majority and they would go look for it</span>
