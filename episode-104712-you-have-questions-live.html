Do you think there&#39;s any room in the NDP strategy to try and get more student voters out to the polls, especially at, like, UFC, MRU, Lethbridge, and those more kind of competitive areas?</div>

Before that leaders debate, almost, I think almost every poll, maybe one or two, had changed at the start of the week, but they&#39;d all shown the wild rose in the lead, and afterwards they all showed the NDP in the lead.</div>

It&#39;s tough to run a government. There&#39;s two things to keep in mind, though. One is there&#39;s the legislature and there&#39;s the passing of legislation, and that becomes almost impossible in a 44-43 split if the government does the speaker, because then every vote&#39;s 43-43, the speaker by convention is supposed to vote to maintain the status quo. Doesn&#39;t drop confidence, but means you&#39;re not passing a lot of things.</div>

And I think you would see more government happen through regs in that particular situation. But also it empowers every individual MLA Like</div>
