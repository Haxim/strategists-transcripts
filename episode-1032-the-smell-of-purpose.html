            <span class="text">So 39 Ontario Liberals, including former cabinet ministers and recent candidates, they signed an open letter to Ontario Green Leader Mike Schreiner. It was released today, Sunday. the letter pleads with mike to be their leader it reads we are a group of ontario liberals who are deeply concerned about the state of politics in ontario goes</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">goes on to say our politics are stuck in an endless loop of gimmicks and cynical games and it um it goes on it talks about why they&#39;re taking this unprecedented step compliments mike&#39;s career his principles it talks about climate change, healthcare, youth. And there&#39;s also a website, draftmike.ca, where people are urged to sign on to the campaign to draft Mike. They can also read the letter there. So just super quickly for those not super familiar with Ontario politics, Mike Schreiner, he&#39;s been Green Party leader since 2009. He won a seat in the 2018 election and became the first Green MPP in ontario history he was re-elected in 2022 and was again the only green candidate elected so the letter comes as the liberals are looking for a leader and at least four current liberal mpps and mps are actively exploring leadership bids they&#39;re just waiting for timelines and rules from the party and there&#39;s an agm happening in the next month or so so um that&#39;s my intro my question Question for you guys. And Carter, let&#39;s start with you. You&#39;ve got some thoughts.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">What do you think of this draftmike.ca campaign and the open letter? I guess, what type of message does it tell people when you come out and essentially say, there&#39;s no candidate good enough to lead our party except this guy who&#39;s not even part of our party? You&#39;ve got thoughts, Carter.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s not a great message, especially when you&#39;re going from someone who, like a party that won eight seats in the legislature versus a party that won one seat in the legislature. Now, I&#39;m not an expert in math, Annalise, but I think, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, eight is higher than one. Is it not? You</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">You got it, Carter. It&#39;s higher. I would also go</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">go so far as to say that 39 liberals writing a letter would be in excess of the key people in the Green Party. They could just take over the Green Party if they wanted, with 39 people, 39 key organizers, if they really wanted this guy, they could all just move over and support him. I mean, the strategy of something like this, the draft campaign, and I&#39;ll just kind of quickly digress over this direction for a second. It&#39;s a great strategy. The draft is a great way to start a campaign without starting a campaign. We did a draft campaign prior to him running in 2010. It gave us the opportunity to find a lot of volunteers. It gave us the opportunity to sign up a lot of potential voters. It didn&#39;t cost us very much. We grew our Facebook page. It was fantastic back when Facebook used to matter.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So that was a good piece. And if this was being done by Mike Schreiner by himself to actually get himself as the leader of the Liberal Party, then I don&#39;t dislike this strategy. It shows that he&#39;s got 39 key Liberals that will be on his campaign right from the beginning. That&#39;s a great strategy. However, if this is actually 39 Liberals reaching out to bring in Mike and he doesn&#39;t want the job, as he&#39;s saying in the media, this is beyond pathetic. This could be the worst execution I&#39;ve ever seen. I wrote down here, and maybe this is an episode title, I&#39;m just throwing it out out there 39 liberals or 39 morons i don&#39;t know i can&#39;t tell the difference it&#39;s it&#39;s really tight okay</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">welcome to the to the podcast yes it is possible that this is being run by mike himself This is beyond possible is most actually likely. The most draft campaigns are being run with the full endorsement of the person who is being drafted. It is a pre-campaign. It looks like it&#39;s grassroots. It creates this huge amount of energy. I would not be surprised at all if Mike and his team, these 39 people, are all in cahoots about getting him to actually move from a party that can only win one seat to a party that can win 800% as many seats.</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">You say something different and it&#39;s over. Can you take over with the naivete, Corey? I&#39;m struggling with the naivete. Okay. I&#39;m struggling.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">me how this actually works. You also think this draft is a great strategy, Corey. Is that what is on your face there?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, look, I think this is a pretty conventional strategy in many ways to have to be asked to do the job. You know, ask me three times is the old joke, right? right? Oh no, oh no. Okay, sure, I&#39;ll absolutely do it. You&#39;ve twisted my arm. And if that is what it is, then</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">then okay, it&#39;s a fine strategy. I mean, we&#39;re all talking. The 39 liberals, by the way, I certainly don&#39;t know all of them or even most of them, but even a lot of the ones that are like liberal organizer, and you&#39;re like, what is that? They are known liberal organizers. They are people within the party with some sort of swing. So it&#39;s a baffling one if this is just kind of of like taking a flyer especially because there are four candidates in the race and holy cow did they leave their party looking bad if uh if schreiner doesn&#39;t come in schreiner didn&#39;t say</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">mean he said his focus is to continue the fight right and he has also made some comments i&#39;m just trying to find the words here uh along the lines of i haven&#39;t seen anything that would change my mind right now yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah right like you know so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so there there is like kind of that the smallest of the doors open where perhaps like a big swing would allow would allow them to be like well i guess now i see like there&#39;s an enthusiasm for green politics that was never there before but you know you almost have to play this out with like the two scenarios right the one is is this uh shriner&#39;s brilliant play to take over the leadership of the third party the one that got the second most votes in in ontario and and really try to go for something or is this like a desperate appeal from an absolutely moribund Liberal Party that doesn&#39;t know what to do. And yeah, I don&#39;t know which one I&#39;m more excited to talk about, because both are pretty interesting. But, you know, they tell such different stories. And I guess we won&#39;t know for sure for a bit. Although if I was going to put money on the table right now, my sense is, Schreiner does not want to be leader of the Liberal Party, and that this is essentially a cold call. Although I&#39;ve never seen anything like that. let&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">That&#39;s the equivalent of this.

And then the draftmike.ca website, you would think perhaps there are conversations, but a few things there. Carter, you said this has been done before Common Strategy. Has it been done in terms of publicly like this with a leader from another party? Like, I think we need to be clear. These are two different parties. Well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think we have to exclude Raj Sherman from all of these discussions because Raj Sherman is literally, I think, run for every leadership in every party. But if you eliminate Raj Sherman, then it is fairly uncommon for one person to leave the leadership of a small party and become the leader of a big party. But on the other hand, part of this is we don&#39;t usually see small parties like this. We don&#39;t usually see small parties like this that have much in the way of leadership hope. I mean, most of the time what we see is a Green Party that&#39;s led by Elizabeth May. And people really don&#39;t even want her leading the Greens, let alone leading any other parties. So I think that this is it&#39;s unusual to be sure. But I don&#39;t I&#39;m not sure that this is outside of all reasonable expectations. expectations and maybe cory you&#39;ve got more thoughts yeah cory jump in there so</span>

It was a different time. And so Bracken said he would run for leader and he was drafted in a kind of a similar fashion. There was like a draft Bracken campaign.</span>

You get elected by slowly moving the game and becoming better at the game. You get elected by being able to find lots of people who like you, which is politics. I got an argument today with the proportional representation people. Again, the proportional representation people are never going to succeed because they don&#39;t understand what they&#39;re actually arguing for or what they&#39;re trying to achieve. I think that this is the same thing that we see all the time with small parties small parties think oh we can turn everybody around they&#39;re all going to love us all of a sudden because we don&#39;t do politics the same as everybody else yeah that means you&#39;re a loser the rest of us do politics the way we do because we&#39;ve studied the art we look at it and we understand how to win and that is that is politics as usual politics as usual is about learning how to win basing it on 3 000 years of experience in democracies um some of which have have gone south and some of which haven&#39;t very</span>

            <span class="text">right Right. So it means different things to different people. All of them will, I think, should give some sort of questioning to that, whether they have any kind of sense of judgment. I mean, to put out a letter that says we&#39;re a good political party, all we need is a purpose. Let me cold call somebody we believe has a purpose. I mean, that just seems to undercut their party immensely. immensely but uh it really depends on who you are on this list like we can start with lucille collard who is a liberal mpp like in the legislature i</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, members of the Legislative Assembly don&#39;t go out on a limb like this without knowing how it&#39;s actually going to end. And I mean, we can see that right here in Calgary, right here in Alberta, like we have a lunatic in the premier&#39;s chair and a lot of sane MLAs aren&#39;t moving because it&#39;s insane to take that type of action without knowing how it ends. So I think that these MPPs know how it&#39;s going to end because they&#39;ve been in rooms with this guy and they can see that he&#39;s going to run. he just needs them to build up the the momentum otherwise the cost is too high cory&#39;s point is right on cory&#39;s point like if this mp you know if the current mpps um don&#39;t succeed in moving him over and there&#39;s not a fifth candidate they&#39;re done in this party they&#39;re done so they may as well just go sit as an independent right now or better yet move to the fucking green party he&#39;s</span>

It is a leadership campaign that is up and running. And I would be willing to bet a nickel or two that by the end of this week, he&#39;s running in this campaign or</span>

            <span class="text">to leave it there. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s one we will revisit in the future. Next segment. Happy anniversary, truckers. So today is Sunday. It&#39;s the one year anniversary of the Freedom Convoy. boy um to market dozens of people gathered on parliament hill during a snowstorm and they told reporters they were there to say in the share the same message as last year no more vaccine mandates they shouted freedom they waved canadian flags um i even saw a video on twitter where they were wrapping their tents in saran wrap because it was snowing saran wrap um and then closer to home protesters returned to coots on the one year anniversary of the coots border blockade so different things to pick apart here but my first big question for you two and cory we can start with you on this one it&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s been a year since um those initial protests and since then we&#39;ve seen conservative leaders win leadership contests by appealing to these convoy supporters um i&#39;m I&#39;m thinking of Danielle Smith and Pierre Polyev here. Over</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Over the coming year or years, as these leaders face general elections, I guess, what do you think their relationship with the convoy looks like? And what should that relationship look like if they want to win?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, so on one hand with Danielle Smith, I think that the spirit of the convoy really really obviously propelled her to the leadership. And she&#39;s beholden to that group in a way. I actually don&#39;t believe Pierre Poliev is. I think Pierre Poliev won so commandingly and with so many people from so many walks in his party that that was maybe grabbing a little bit of extra enthusiasm, trying to put out some fires around the People&#39;s Party of Canada. But I don&#39;t think his leadership hinges on the support of those individuals. And if they walked away from him, he would still have his leadership. So, but both of them are going to listen more or less depending on the strength of that particular wing. And so one of the interesting things always when people try to mark an anniversary like this is you can really expose how weak you&#39;ve become as well, right? Or how irrelevant you&#39;ve become.

And that smell is sticking to certain people. And I think that the smell will stick to Polyev more than Corey is suggesting, because although he chose to and found support amongst many different groups, he also chose to find the people who were, you know, the lockdown, the trucker protest gang. gang and really i think it&#39;s a misnomer to call it the trucker protest i mean i think it was the i think or the convoy protest i think ultimately it it was too too much focused on uh racism too much focused on um you know what i&#39;m losing because there&#39;s all these other groups and too much based on the the trump type of uh messaging of where&#39;s mine why don&#39;t i get mine too so i I find the group, because it&#39;s died so quickly, that stench is going to follow it. And I think that that stench is going to land on Pierre Pauliev. And maybe Danielle Smith, Danielle Smith a little bit less because we have a bit bigger group of people that are willing to abide by the stench of rancid meat. But that&#39;s about it.

And I think that&#39;s ridiculous that you&#39;re thinking of it only in the downside sense, because this group did show it had significant power and momentum last year. It gave her the fucking premiership, for crying out loud. The power of that group matters in this province way more than it matters, way more than it matters in federal politics. It has already fundamentally changed politics in the province of Alberta, and it has the power to change politics again, depending on whether it shows up or not and how it shows up. Because if that group shows up, and they&#39;ve got all of this cock and swagger, and they change the Conservative Party platform to something that&#39;s so deeply unpalatable to Albertans, and that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about for 28 days during an election, they lose. lose if they are weakened that&#39;s</span>

Pierre Palliev has more time between the convoy and his election. I see no logical way you can come to the conclusion that convoy politics is more relevant to Pierre Palliev&#39;s future than Daniel Smith&#39;s future.</span>

The convoy bad, right? Which is part of why it was so baffling that the conservatives were so all in on it at the moment. But with time, as we all want to forget it, people, you know, the jury seems to be a little bit out on how people are going to think about all of this in the future here. And ultimately, I don&#39;t think Ottowans who had to experience it are going to think very positively of it. But I think most of of us won&#39;t think anything about it at all and um if if there&#39;s more canadians out there who are saying yeah in general that time kind of sucked and those people were mad that it sucked as it just blurs and fades into history i just i don&#39;t you</span>

The Maritimes did such a good job, I think, of keeping COVID numbers down. It became such a draw and it&#39;s obviously very beautiful. And when you could work remotely, it brought in a lot of people. So a lot of the pressures we&#39;re seeing in the rest of Canada are kind of hitting Nova Scotia shores in a way that they haven&#39;t for the first time in a long time, with increased costs, you know, what that means for the communities around there. They&#39;ve got a PC party that seems to be taking the different model from the Conservative Party federally, and that they&#39;re becoming more moderate, more P than C, right? right? With Houston. I think there&#39;s a lot we could potentially draw from there. And, um,</span>

            <span class="text">okay We&#39;ve got a couple more important questions, Carter. Here&#39;s one. How can the NDP leverage interest groups like unions in the lead up to the election?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s become much harder because of the new laws that I think they brought in and then the UCP strengthened the prohibit donations to election financing from unions. Unions at this stage are basically hamstrung to communicating only with their members, and even then, it may not be wise for them to be communicating about election issues lest they be referred to the elections commissioner. So my thinking is that if they hadn&#39;t used the union membership lists and the union communications options last year when the Elections Act didn&#39;t apply in the same fashion, then they really are going to be in trouble. Because almost every one of those options for using unions</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">unions and using labor and other associations, almost all of them are gone because of the Elections Act and the changes, especially that the UCP made. So my sense is they probably didn&#39;t get their shit together, but the unions probably did. So there was probably some communication from unions to their membership through last year that they&#39;re hoping will carry into next year or this year, I guess.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, do you have anything to add to that one?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, look, there are interest groups. Find common interest. It doesn&#39;t necessarily need to just be about ads and spending money and having volunteers on lists. Open doors, make statements, encourage their sharing. The fact of the matter is unions, other interest groups, they include, they have their own machines,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">machines, right? And they have their own groups and their own identification and their own group interest. And in politics, you&#39;re always trying to assemble coalitions of those groups. And these are more organized than most. So by all means, continue to treat them as very important stakeholders within the process and move forward. Just know that Stephen&#39;s right. The rules are now a little bit different as we&#39;ve gotten closer to an election, but it doesn&#39;t need to fundamentally change things. And simply because there are limits and reporting requirements doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s not still value. But</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But I want to jump on that because what you&#39;re saying, like now</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">now you get to treat them like every other social network, right? So when you&#39;re campaigning at this stage, politicians should be focused on accessing different, as many social networks as they can, whether it&#39;s the neighborhood hockey team, the neighborhood soccer team, the cricket team, whatever they may be, or union members in the region. If there happens to be a disproportionate member, number of members in your, in your riding, bringing those union members together, that&#39;s accessing the social networks. And that&#39;s what, that&#39;s what they can be doing all the time. And that&#39;s probably the most effective, uh, the most effective use. I just would be very, very careful, uh, to make sure that you&#39;re not overstepping the, uh, the shitty rules. You want to make sure</span>

            <span class="text">maybe five, because it was just whack-a-mole, right? Like, the thing is, and we&#39;ve talked about this on the pod, but I just want to kind of say again, we went from what was more of a principles-based approach, which is the way everything else in the world is going towards in</span>

            <span class="text">terms of accounting and whatnot, which is, you know, you&#39;ve got to maintain the spirit of these things. And we&#39;re not going to write out a bunch of very specific rules. We&#39;re just going to say you can&#39;t act in a shitty fashion. And we went to a rules-based approach where we delineated everything you were allowed to do. But in the process of doing so, we created a guidebook for everything you&#39;re allowed to do. And people started looking for loopholes and ways around it. And because it was no longer principles-based, right? Like, this kind of collusion is bad. And then it became this kind of collusion in this way is bad. They&#39;re like, well, how about in these other ways then? You know, in this way, that way, the other way. And the number of unintended consequences that were created and had to be addressed time and time and time again. This is the problem whenever you have a rules-based system. And maybe we need one because we&#39;re in such steeply cynical times. Principles don&#39;t seem to be carrying us very far. My goodness, the Ontario Liberal Party apparently doesn&#39;t even have any, if you listen to these open letter writers. But it</span>

Because they created these rules of how to do these things, you know how many TPAs there were in 2012? Zero. Didn&#39;t need to be TPAs. All the money went to the parties. The parties then used the money to talk about their principles. And now there&#39;s TPAs all over the place. And each one is, you know, was given the rule book by Elections Alberta.

            <span class="text">the United Conservative Party told Justin Trudeau, we don&#39;t want your resources. We don&#39;t want your money. We don&#39;t want to help the 10,000 people in Calgary that are out of work, the 30,000 people that are out of work in the province that lost their jobs, not because of regular ebb and flow of the economy, me, but lost their jobs because of the changes that occurred in the oil patch and in oil and gas. People say, oh, there&#39;s lots of jobs in oil and gas. There are jobs in oil and gas. They&#39;re not the same jobs that there used to be. And the people who&#39;ve been orphaned, the people who&#39;ve been left behind are the ones that, you know, the geophysicists, the geologists, the senior engineers, the people in their 40s, 50s, 60s, they had been working for these companies for 20, 30, 30, 40 years. And now there&#39;s no jobs for them. And they were making real good money, but not enough to just stop working for the rest of their lives. And now the government is going back hat in hand because they recognize they need the federal government&#39;s resources if we&#39;re actually going to make a difference in these people&#39;s lives. And that&#39;s why I was pissed at the NDP, because the NDP are supposed to care about people. And they should have stood up and said, I don&#39;t care what the fuck you call it. You got to make sure that we&#39;re taking care of the the people who&#39;ve been left behind by the changes that have been made whether it&#39;s in the coal industry the oil industry the gas industry whatever industry is shifting we got to try and make sure that we&#39;re not leaving people behind because as the alberta party accurately pointed out ai is taking all of our jobs cory</span>

Everything Stephen said would be right, right? It would be all of a sudden it&#39;s an about face. They&#39;re finally coming around to a reasoned argument that the NDP was at for a long time. It becomes a difficult thing for them during the election. But because Rachel Notley opposed it, opposition became universal in the province of Alberta. Danielle Smith then had the ability to say, we all hate it, but now I&#39;m offering you the olive branch. Let&#39;s sit down. Let&#39;s make a deal. And if she makes a deal, she takes off the table the idea that she can&#39;t work with Justin Trudeau. Like, it actually rat fucks Rachel Notley and the NDP rather brilliantly, if you&#39;re the UCP, if she manages to pull something off here, because they</span>
